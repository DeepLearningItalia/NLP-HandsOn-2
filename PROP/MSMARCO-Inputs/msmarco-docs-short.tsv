At age 8, your child will likely have developed some interests and hobbies and will know what he or she likes or doesn't like. At the same time, children this age are learning more about the world at large and are also better able to navigate social relationships with others more independently, with less guidance from parents. At home, 8-year-olds are able to tackle more complicated household chores and take on more responsibility for taking care of themselves, even helping out with younger siblings. In general, according to the CDC, these are some changes you may see in your child: Shows more independence from parents and family. Starts to think about the future. Understands more about his or her place in the world. Pays more attention to friendships and teamwork. Wants to be liked and accepted by friends.1 Behavior and Daily Routines Fabrice Le Rouge/Getty Images The 8-year-old's behavior and daily routines are shaped by the child's taste, interests, and personality. Parents and other significant adults in the child's life should keep in mind the importance of being good role models since this is a time when children are figuring out the world and who they are and how they fit into it. At this age, your child may get involved with more complex social activities and behaviors that help define his or her sense of self. Effective discipline techniques at this age include continuing to praise good behavior, focusing your child's efforts, what they can do and change, rather than innate traits (such as ""you are smart""). Set up and enforce consistent rules. Discipline should be aimed at guiding your child rather than punishing. Follow it with a discussion with your child about what she could do differently next time. Your 8-year-old can do more self-care in regards to hygiene and may begin to want to be part of deciding what the family eats. You might begin to give your child chores to contribute to the maintenance of the household and an allowance to begin to learn to manage money. At this age, your child still needs 10 to 11 hours of sleep per night.2 Physical Development Image Source/Getty Images For 8-year-old children, physical development will continue to be more about refinement of skills, coordination, and muscle control rather than huge changes. They begin to look like ""big kids,"" but puberty is still a couple of years away for most of them. Children with natural athletic potential may show their abilities at this developmental stage as their physical skills become more precise and accurate. In fact, this is often the age at which children decide whether they are athletic or not, and choose to participate in or avoid sports. Either way, it's important for parents to encourage physical activity. Even if your child isn't an athlete she can still enjoy running, swimming, biking, and many other types of non-sports-related physical fun.3 Emotional Development John Howard/Getty Images Eight-year-old emotional development may be growing at a deeper level than in younger years, and an 8-year-old may show more sophisticated and complex emotions and interactions. For instance, an 8-year-old may mask true thoughts or emotions to spare someone else's feelings or work through a problem without an adult's close supervision or intervention. This is the time when your child may be developing a more sophisticated sense of himself in the world. Her interests, talents, friends, and relationship with family all help her to establish a clear self-identity. It's also the beginning of desiring privacy and flip-flopping between self-confidence and self-doubt. It can be a good time to help your child develop patience and empathy for others.4 Cognitive Development Tom Merton/Getty Images Eight-year-old children are at a stage of intellectual development where they will be able to pay attention for longer periods of time. You can expect your child to be able to concentrate on an activity for up to an hour or more. Eight-year-olds will also be able to think more critically and express opinions using more complex and sophisticated vocabulary and language skills.5 Social Development Christopher Futcher/Getty Images This is the phase of social development where many children love being a part of sports teams and other social groups. In general, 8-year-old children enjoy school and will count on and value relationships with a few close friends and classmates. Parents of 8-year-olds should be on the lookout for problems such as school refusal, as this may indicate learning difficulties or being bullied at school. It is also a good age at which to discuss respecting others.6 What If My Child Is Different? Developmental milestones provide professionals and parents with a tool for comparing children to a norm. No child fits the ideal norm perfectly, and each child will have his or her personal quirks, strengths, challenges, and preferences. With that said, however, if you feel your child is far behind or ahead of the norm, it's well worth discussing the issue with your pediatrician and your child's teacher. If there are issues or opportunities, now is the time to learn about and address them. A Word From Verywell Your 8-year-old is in the full bloom of childhood. Enjoy activities and explore the world together. It's a great time to spark new interests in your child and watch her grow in every way. Sources: Anthony, Michelle.

Yes| No| I need help Ad Everything About Head Lice, Eggs, and Nits Even if you have excellent hygiene, ectoparasites such as lice, can strike. Most often, your child brings it home from school. If you become afflicted with such parasites, you must act quickly and make sure you are thorough in your efforts to get rid of them. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help Lice are wingless and very tiny. They infest your scalp and other body areas such as the pubic and armpit regions. Adult lice lay eggs. When the eggs hatch, they leave shells behind. These shells are called nits. When you see these nits on your scalp or on any area of the body, it is a neon sign of a lice infestation. You should know how to check for lice nits if you want to have a parasite-free body and scalp. It will definitely make you more confident when mingling with other people. Yes, it may be tedious and laborious, but this will help ensure a healthier lifestyle. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help A Basic Description of Lice Recognize lice. You should definitely know how to recognize lice. These are wingless, tiny arthropods (six-legged invertebrates) that reside on your scalp. Lice are ectoparasites that rely on your blood to survive. They are about the size of a sesame seed. Lice are like mosquitoes, but instead of flying, they do best with crawling. You can get lice by being in direct contact with someone infested with head lice. Another way would be to share items such as headbands, clips, combs, or hats. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help Eggs The female head lice lay eggs. These eggs are almost invisible to the naked eye because they're tiny and they blend into the color of your hair. Female head lice usually lay their eggs on the hair shafts near the hair roots. They attach with an adhesive that's naturally waterproof. That is why they cannot be blown or washed away. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help By the time the head lice eggs hatch, they leave empty eggshells behind. These are called nits. You could confuse nits with hairspray flakes, sand, or dandruff. Like the lice eggs, nits still have their adhesives so they cannot be removed that easily. Nits differ in coloration (brownish yellow, white). As the hair grows, the attached nits are found away from the roots. Since nits are indications of lice infestation, many schools do not admit children who have them. It is important for parents to check their children's heads for nits and eggs on a regular basis so that lice treatment could be performed immediately. Removing nits and lice eggs takes patience and a fine-toothed comb. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help Life Cycle of Head Lice Head lice have three phases in their life cycle (40-50 days):1 Egg phase. The mature female lays eggs that are coated with an adhesive. This adhesive is effective for attaching the eggs to the hair shafts near the hair roots. The newly hatched head lice will hatch after 10 days. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Nymph phase. A nymph comes out of the head lice egg. They are not that easy to see. Nymphs cannot reproduce yet because they don't have a fully developed reproductive system yet. It takes 12 days for lice nymphs to mature. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Adult phase. This is the phase where the nymphs are finally mature enough to produce and lay eggs. Once they are sexually mature, they can lay four to 10 eggs every day. The life of adult head lice lasts about 28 days. Don't panic, but about 280 lice eggs could be laid by one mature female before she dies. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help How to Check for Head Lice, Nits, and Eggs You can tell if there is a head lice infestation when the suspected host itches all the time. Oftentimes, children scratch their heads, nape, or behind the ears. Red bumps or small wounds might also be present in these areas. Once you notice itching or bumps, immediately check your child's head. There could already be a head lice outbreak in their school. You can check for head lice, nits, and eggs by using the following steps: Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help First Check For Lice1 Choose a relaxing place. Select a comfortable area for head lice checking. You should position your child seated in front of you. This will allow you to check all over your child's head conveniently. Do not do this on furniture that's upholstered, as lice may end up there. Go for a kitchen chair instead...you might even want to do this on the back deck. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Make sure there is natural light. It should be bright enough so you could detect the nits. The tiny adult lice do move quickly so you have to have appropriate lighting to see them. Head lice eggs are translucent. Moving the light around or moving under the light helps pinpoint them. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Fully examine the scalp. Part areas of hair and look closely at the scalp, the area behind the ears, and the nape. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help The Wet Hair Technique Detecting head lice, eggs, and nits can be done by combing the hair with a fine-toothed comb. This method takes 5-15 minutes, depending on the thickness and the length of the hair. This can also be used as part of the treatment. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help1 Wash the hair with regular shampoo. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Rinse the hair thoroughly and apply regular conditioner. Use three times the amount you usually use and do not rinse it out of the hair. This makes it really easy to comb. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Use a regular comb to remove tangles. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 Get a fine-toothed comb or a detection comb. There are detection combs that come with or without prescriptions, available at any drug store. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help5 Comb the hair using the detection comb. Make sure that it touches the scalp and reaches the tips of the hair. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help6 Work the entire head. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help7 Look at the comb and check for lice, nits, and eggs. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help8 If there are lice, nits, or eggs in the comb, wash it thoroughly first before running it through the hair again. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help9 Continue this process over the entire head. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help10 Rinse off the conditioner . Repeat the combing process to make sure every area is dealt with. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help Dry Hair Technique This only takes about 3-5 minutes, depending on the hair's thickness. This is not effective for treating lice, only detecting it.1 Use an ordinary comb to untangle and straighten dry hair. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Use the detection comb as soon as the tangles are removed. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Start combing from the hair base to the hair tips. Do this about three to four times before combing the next area. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 Examine the detection comb for lice, nits, and eggs. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help5 If there are any lice, nits or eggs in the comb, rinse the comb and dry it thoroughly before using it again. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help6 Perform the process until every portion of the hair is cleared. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help Symptoms of Pubic Lice Pubic lice can also be acquired. This is spread through sexual intercourse. If a sexual partner detects pubic lice infestation in his or her own pubic area, both sexual partners should be treated to avoid spreading the parasites again. Pubic lice are usually grey or brown. They can be acquired from infested clothes, bedding, and towels. Pubic lice look like tiny crabs and that's why they are also known as ""crabs"". These are the symptoms you have to watch out for: Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help1 Grey dots or brown dots present on the skin near or on the pubic area. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Intense level of itching. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 White eggs on the pubic hair shafts, very close to the roots. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 Pubic lice can also be present on the hair shafts of hair that grow on your underarms, trunk, and thighs. They could even be present in mustaches and beards. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help Treatment of Pubic Lice1 Use special lice shampoos that are formulated to kill pubic lice. These shampoos work on dry pubic hair. Just be careful not to let the shampoo get in contact with mucus areas such as the anus or the vagina. The shampoo could burn or irritate the mucus areas. Leave the shampoo for on to 10 minutes. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Pour on enough warm water to lather the shampoo up. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Rinse the area thoroughly. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 If the patient has a hairy pubic area, a detection comb should be used to check for head lice, nits, and eggs. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help5 Rinse thoroughly. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help6 Wash all clothes, sheets, undergarments, and towels using warm water for 20 minutes. This will ensure the death of the crabs. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help7 Perform another treatment after seven to 10 days of the first treatment to get rid of the newly hatched pubic lice. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help8 You might want to consider shaving the public hair to the skin, but don't do it anytime near the special shampoo. You really don't want that stuff absorbing into your skin. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help Symptoms of Body Lice Body lice move to your skin to feed and then return to the seams of your clothes. They lay their eggs in the seams. Home lice sprays can be used to kill the adult lice, nits, and eggs. Spray them on non-washable objects, vehicle interiors, furniture, and mattresses. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help Treatment for Body Lice After ridding your body of lice, wash all linens, coats, scarves, hats (washable ones), towels, and garments using hot water. Use high heat in drying them for about 20 minutes. If the items are non-washable, have them dry-cleaned. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help Personal hygiene is important and checking for lice nits is a very significant part of it. Be vigilant in preventing this infestation so that you could have a lice-free, healthy lifestyle. Alternative Method For Removing Lice Without Harsh Chemicals This is an effective way to remove lice and nits from your child's hair, without the use of any dangerous chemicals. If you've got longer hair, tie it up while you're doing this process...just to be safer. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help What You'll Need Conditioner. Get a bottle or jar of thick conditioner - doesn't have to be expensive. Shampoo. Two towels. Four clips to hold hair out of your way. Plastic bag that will fit over the affected person's head. Fine-toothed comb. Blow dryer. Flat iron. This isn't a clothes iron, but like a curling iron, but flat. Girls use it to straighten their hair. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help Instructions For Dealing With Lice1 Put on your gloves. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Put a towel around the neck of the person you're helping. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Work with dry hair that has been combed to remove tangles. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 Part the hair into four sections. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help5 Smother them. Starting in the first section, from the nap of the neck, part the hair in ½ inch sections, putting a big dollop of conditioner at the roots. Make the next parting, more conditioner, and so on. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help6 Remove the clip each time you start a new section. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help7 You'll actually see the critters crawling out of your way, and by the time you get to the front - where the bangs are, you'll see them all huddling. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help8 Smother the roots with conditioner. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help9 Now add tons of conditioner until the entire head is covered thickly with the conditioner. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help10 Place the plastic bag over the head, only covering the hair, and clip to secure. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help11 Spend a half an hour holding the blow dryer on high heat, all over the head. Make sure you don't spend too long in one place, as you might burn the person you're treating. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help12 Take off the bag, and lean them over a sink or the tub. Comb the hair over and over - with the conditioner still in the hair. The comb should move fairly easily through the hair. As you comb, you'll see dead lice coming out of the hair. Comb and comb and comb. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help13 Shampoo the hair - twice. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help14 Clean up half way through . Throw away the gloves and the plastic bag. Put them into another plastic bag, tie it, and put it right outside in the garbage. Wash the comb and clips carefully. Put the towel you've used straight into the washer. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help Instructions For Dealing With The Nits Now you've killed the lice, but you still have the nits to deal with.1 Heat up the flat iron. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Dry the hair completely - it cannot even be damp. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Section the hair the same way you did for the conditioner. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 One section at a time - starting from the nap of the neck, iron each section of hair with the flat iron trying to get close to the scalp, but taking great care not to burn your child - or whomever you're helping.

D2147834	http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/business/global/05tower.html	Dubai Opens a Tower to Beat All	Global Business Dubai Opens a Tower to Beat All By LANDON THOMAS Jr. JAN. 4, 2010A visitor gets a view of Dubai from the 124th floor of Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, on Monday. Ali Haider/European Pressphoto Agency Burdened by debt and a devastating real estate crash, Dubai is doing what it does best: doubling down. Just one month after a close brush with bankruptcy, Dubai celebrated the opening of the world’s tallest building on Monday — a rocket-shaped edifice that soars 2,717 feet and has views that reach 60 miles. The glittering celebration may have been an attempt by Dubai’s ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, to shift the focus from Dubai’s current economic troubles to a future filled with more promise. All the same, the tower’s success by no means signals a recovery in Dubai’s beaten-down real estate market, where prices have collapsed by as much as 50 percent and many developers are having trouble finding occupants for their buildings. With its mix of nightclubs, mosques, luxury suites and boardrooms, the Burj is an almost perfect representation of Dubai’s own complexities and contradictions. It will have the world’s first Armani hotel; the world’s highest swimming pool, on the 76th floor; the highest observation deck, on the 124th floor; and the highest mosque, on the 158th floor. Related Coverage The World’s Tallest Building JAN. 4, 2010Fireworks Greet Tallest Skyscraper But in deciding to change the tower’s name from Burj Dubai to Burj Khalifa, in honor of the president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Dubai revealed a rare streak of humility consistent with its diminished economic condition. Once the most proudly autonomous of Arab Emirates, Dubai has found that its financial troubles have made it more dependent on Abu Dhabi and more likely to be drawn closer into the federation.“Dubai not only has the world’s tallest building, but has also made what looks like the most expensive naming rights deal in history,” said Jim Krane, the author of “City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism.” “Renaming the Burj Dubai after Sheik Khalifa of Abu Dhabi — if not an explicit quid pro quo — is a down payment on Dubai’s gratitude for its neighbor’s $10 billion bailout last month.”The opening festivities had the feel of a national holiday, with fireworks, parachute jumps and shooting streams of water from the world’s tallest fountain. At a cost estimated at $1.5 billion, the Burj took five years to build, is more than 160 floors high and has comfortably surpassed the previous record holder in Taiwan, the Taipei 101. More than 12,000 people will occupy its six million square feet, zooming up and down in 54 elevators that can reach speeds of 40 miles an hour. It was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in Chicago. At a time when several of Dubai’s newly built office towers stand empty, it is 90 percent sold, according to the building’s developer, Emaar Properties. To be sure, some have questioned the utility of such a towering project. At least three foreign workers died during the construction. And at a time of increasing concerns over global terrorism, such a building could pose an inviting target. The Burj Khalifa was named in honor of the president of Abu Dhabi. Charles Crowell/Bloomberg News But to Dubai, which from its very beginning has taken pleasure in proving its doubters wrong, the Burj is evidence that if you build it big and brash enough the people will come, from near and far. With its strong government backing and unquestioned prestige, the Burj was a project that was destined to succeed and its developer, Emaar, had little difficulty in attracting residents — particularly since much of the space was sold several years ago in the middle of Dubai’s real estate frenzy. Other projects, however, have not been so lucky. One is the Omniyat Bayswater, a 24-story office building that stands less than half a mile from the Burj. It opened six months ago and remains more than 50 percent vacant.

See Sample Privacy Policy Opt out or contact us anytime Aimed to be the flagship structure of an ambitious development project in an area by the sea called Business Bay, Omniyat Bayswater has been unable to attract tenants as a consequence of the current real estate crisis. But its struggle speaks to a larger truth behind the Dubai real estate bubble which, despite the excitement over the Burj, could well forestall a meaningful recovery. Like many office projects developed four or five years ago, the peak years of Dubai’s expansion, the Omniyat Bayswater is plagued by splintered ownership. It is estimated to have more than 50 landlords — more than two per floor — with some trying to lease office suites as small as 1,000 square feet. A spokesman for Omniyat said that the developer recognized the problem of multiple owners, and had taken steps to address it and expected to see whole floors leased by the second quarter of this year. At a time when selling real estate was like handing out candy to children, the development model of selling to many owners, known as strata title, became a quick and easy way to finance building projects. Speculators from around the world were clamoring for the smallest slice of Dubai property. But with the crash, the building’s ownership structure has made it extremely difficult to sell or lease a floor or two to foreign companies seeking to expand.“There has been a difficulty in creating a collective of owners,” said Nick Maclean of the real estate firm CB Richard Ellis in Dubai. “The majority of the building is empty.”Few offers have been made for space in buildings under strata title, which is estimated to cover about two-thirds of the new buildings opening this year and 70 percent of those opening in 2011. Without government action, office vacancy rates could rise as high as 40 percent, according to real estate analysts. As for the effect the Burj will have on the overall market, Mr. Maclean said that its opening, while heartening, was unlikely to prompt an immediate turn around in the market.“It is a unique building and symbolically important but it is not going to stimulate demand,” he said. Correction: January 7, 2010An article on Tuesday about the opening of the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, misstated the position of Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, for whom the tower is named. He is president of the United Arab Emirates, not of Abu Dhabi. (He is emir of Abu Dhabi.) The error also appeared in a picture caption accompanying the article and was repeated in an editorial on Wednesday. The editorial also misstated the beneficiary of a $10 billion loan from Abu Dhabi. It was the emirate of Dubai, not the United Arab Emirates. A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2010, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Dubai Opens A Tower To Beat All. Order Reprints Today's Paper Subscribe

D1885729	http://www.ehow.com/how_8327605_kill-weeds-killing-plants.html	How to Kill Weeds Without Killing Plants	Weeds invade lawns and gardens, robbing the good plants from valuable nutrients they need to grow. Weeds are never completely eradicated because their seeds fall into the soil and remain viable. By taking the time to remove the weeds, you will keep the other vegetation safe. Some steps will help you keep many of the weeds from coming back into the garden. Things You'll Need Gardening gloves Pre-emergent herbicide Selective herbicide or post-emergent herbicide Mulch Newspaper Pull the weeds by hand. Put on some gardening gloves and grasp the weed as close to the soil line as possible. Give a quick pull and the weed should come out of the ground--roots and all. It the weeds do not pull easily, or if they break off at the stem, water the area first. Apply a pre-emergent herbicide to the soil. It will kill weeds--but not your flowers or other grasses--before the weeds begin to grow. This type of herbicide prevents the weed seeds from germinating and is safe to use around plants. Apply according to label directions. Spray the area with a selective herbicide or a post-emergent herbicide designed to kill weeds but not grass and flowers. Read and follow label directions for application and amounts, as they can vary. Ask the clerk at the garden center for the correct herbicide. Lay down a 2- to 4-inch layer of mulch, if possible. If you have a lot of space between plants, place 12 sheets of newspaper over the soil between plants. Cover the newspaper with mulch and the water it down to keep the newspaper on the ground when wind blows. 
D1311240	http://vanrcook.tripod.com/presidentroosevelt.htm	President Roosevelt Led US To Victory In World War 2	"In World War 2, the three great Allied leaders against Germany were President Roosevelt , Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union. Three finer war leaders could not have been found at any time in history. Churchill, a leader with bulldog tenacity and possessing fine oratorical skills, Stalin, the man of steel, and Roosevelt, the great politician and compromisor, held the allies together when things looked blackest and then led them to victory over the fanatical resistance of the Germans and Japanese. On the other side of the war, Hitler, although an evil person, also had his moments of leadership particularly at the start of the war. But none of the other Axis leaders (certainly not Mussolini!) were of the caliber of the three Allied leaders. Hitler was outnumbered three to one when it came to leadership. This web site deals with President Roosevelt during World War 2. He had followed Herbert Hoover as president in 1933 shortly after the Great Depression began and served as president until 1945 when he died in office just as World War 2 was ending. Vice-President Harry Truman succeeded Roosevelt as president and led America in the immediate post-World War 2 era as the cold war began. FDR's close ties to Winston Churchill are discussed on this web site. `"" The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . ""President Roosevelt. Roosevelt was one of America's greatest presidents. To me, he has always been the perfect example of what an American president should be. Depending on the crisis at hand, Roosevelt undertook whatever corrective steps he thought needed to be taken. A child of the upper class, he, nevertheless, felt it was his duty to help those less fortunate than himself and he initiated the New Deal. The president's wife (and fifth cousin), Eleanor Roosevelt, also had strong feelings in that direction and encouraged FDR in his efforts. Although he often had to compromise with his rich and powerful friends, he was a true champion of the ""forgotten man. ""President Roosevelt was conscious of the power of the presidency and used it as no one ever had before. He worked his way through two major crises in his 4 terms as president: the Great Depression and World War 2. U. S. Unprepared at Beginning of World War 2. After Czechoslovakia fell to Germany in 1938, Roosevelt felt sure that Europe would erupt into war and that the U. S. would be drawn in. He knew the British and French were our natural allies and that Germany was wrong in its forced acquisition of surrounding nations. Even though he knew which side we must support, he could make no overt maneuvers because this country, including Congress, was militantly isolationist at the time. There was opposition to war from both the right and the left. The right wingers were particularly adamant in their opposition. Some even wanted to join Hitler and the Nazis and attack Russia to clean out the communists who they thought were the ""real"" enemy (worse than Hitler!? The right-wingers were a little out of touch with reality). So, even though President Roosevelt watched country after country fall into Nazi Germany's hands in 1939, 1940 and 1941, he was unable to attempt a rescue because American public support was not there. United States Prepares For War All in all, the United States was lightly armed in 1938. The Navy was adequate but the army was woefully small. Roosevelt had to get the country ready for war he knew was probably coming but in such a manner as to not upset the isolationists. He had to move slowly: He did a wonderful job in this effort.1. In November of 1938, President Roosevelt startled his military advisers by advocating the production of 10,000 military aircraft by 1940 and providing the capacity to produce 10,000 planes per year thereafter. This advice did not set well with some advisors who wanted a more balanced approach. But Roosevelt was trying to let Hitler know what America could produce if aroused. He was hoping to discourage Hitler's aggression.2. In July of 1939, Roosevelt issued a military order moving agencies related to defense to report directly to the President and not to the various official government department heads. This created some confusion since the department heads were often left out of matters. However, the order provided a personal relationship between the president and the military chiefs. This is the way Roosevelt liked to work. It also magnified the power of the military chiefs which was a good thing as the nation prepared for war.3. In September of 1940, Roosevelt made a destroyer deal with Great Britain providing them with 50 World War I destroyers in return for a string of bases in the Caribbean.4. In September of 1940, the Selective Service Act was passed and Americans began to be drafted.5. In early 1941, President Roosevelt had Congress pass the ""Lend-Lease Act"" which provided Britain and Russia with arms via lease but with no conditions for repayment. As the president said, ""When your neighbor's house is on fire, one does not haggle over the price to put it out, the hose is readily loaned and the price is figured later. ""America was slowly getting ready for war!U. S. Enters World War 2. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and, on December 11th, Germany declared war on the U. S. (A big mistake by Hitler - otherwise, we might have concentrated on beating Japan first). America was now in World War 2! Americans were no longer isolationists - they were mad as hell and they were not going to take it! Overseas, Churchill, despite the disaster, could not help but feel a great relief (actually he was ecstatic) that America was now in the war. He later wrote,""No American will think it wrong of me if I proclaim that to have the United States at our side was to me the greatest joy.............but now at this very moment I knew the United States was in the war, up to the neck and in to the death. So we had won after all! Yes, after Dunkerque; after the fall of France; .......after the threat of invasion......after seventeen months of lonely fighting......... We had won the war. England would live;......... Our history would not come to an end.... Hitler's fate was sealed.........there was no more doubt about the end. ""Churchill could relax for a moment after standing up to the Nazis, virtually alone, for two years. In retrospect, Churchill's optimistic outlook only partly came true. The Allies won the war all right and both Germany and Japan were defeated. But the British Empire was doomed as the nations who made up the commonwealth began to fly the coop after the war and, finally, Britain was the only significant power left. Although Bitain ended up on the winning side, the empire was finished as were other empires, e.g., German, Italian, French, and Japanese empires. Roosevelt - Churchill Relationship During World War 2. Just prior to the start of World War 2 in September 1939, President Roosevelt had written Churchill (Churchill was not yet prime minister) and the two opened a correspondence and began a warm friendship that would last until Roosevelt's death in 1945 although problems began to occur near the end because of Roosevelt's hesitancy in joining Churchill in moving to limit Soviet Union expansionism. This close relationship between the two leaders, of course, spilled over into the relationship between the countries. It led to the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff which was a joint military command over all British-American operations. It also led to the development of a second front in France, development of an atomic bomb, creation of the United Nations, and final defeat of the axis powers. President Roosevelt as Commander-in Chief During World War 2. Prior to the war and for the first year or so of World War 2, President Roosevelt functioned as the ""real"" Commander-in-Chief of the U. S. armed forces. This is an authority that all presidents have a constitutional right to exercise but few do. Roosevelt was personally involved in all major decisions. One reason for this is that the enemy had the initiative early on and America was developing a strategy to counter the assault and seize the initiative. Alternative methods of conducting the war had to be considered and the president had to decide which way to go. (See Planning & Strategy for more on strategy. )Once the war had gone on for awhile, the tide had turned, America and its allies had the initiative, and a master plan had been developed, so there was no need for President Roosevelt to be so heavily involved. Also, as the war proceeded, the military command system became too large for the personal control Roosevelt liked to exercise. Now he had to depend on theater commanders, the planning staffs, etc. He still used the personal touch with Churchill and his top military advisors but he could no longer control events as he did in pre-war days. This was true of strategy development and in operational planning. Roosevelt was not above stepping in on certain occasions but, essentially, control of military details had shifted to others closer to the action. President Roosevelt still maintained close contact with events through his top assistants - Harry Hopkins and Admiral William Leahy - whom he relied heavily on in making wartime decisions. Early in the conflict, Roosevelt relied more on Hopkins than his military chiefs, however, this changed as the war went on. For his part, Leahy served as a liaison officer or, as Roosevelt called him, ""a sort of leg man,"" transmitting information between the President and the Joint Chiefs. Leahy was a perfect man for the job due to his military seniority, personal friendship with the President, and personality. Largely due to his efforts, the views of the President and the military chiefs never drifted far apart as had occasionally happened early in the war. Roosevelt as Commander-in-Chief - Operation TORCH. Early in the war in 1942, Roosevelt was still acting as the ""real"" Commander-in-Chief and moved forcibly on a critical strategic decision. A joint American - British decision for a cross-channel invasion of France in 1943 (Operation OVERLORD) had been made early on. The plan had been endorsed enthusiastically by the Americans and reluctantly by the British. As time went by, the two sides began squabbling over whether the invasion of France should actually be made in 1943 or delayed until 1944. The American military chiefs even went so far as to recommend that, if the British did not go along with the U. S. invasion plan, the Americans should drop the prevailing Europe-first strategy and begin to move forces to the Pacific theater. In July 1942, Roosevelt intervened strongly in the dispute. He said he would not allow any diversion of forces from Europe to the Pacific. In effect, the British approach won out because of the president's intervention. Instead of an invasion of Europe in 1943, a much less aggressive landing of forces was made in North Africa (Operation TORCH) in late 1942. This substitute action for the now-delayed Operation OVERLORD held the British - American coalition together and the Europe-first strategy was preserved. In retrospect, the decision to delay was probably the correct one because we really were not fully ready for an invasion in 1943. Casualties would have been immense, and indeed, the invasion might have failed. It should be noted that Stalin became infuriated with the postponement of Operation OVERLORD. He was in favor of a second front as early as possible to take pressure off his country. The Russians were already taking immense casualties - they were not that concerned that others might have to share taking casualties with them. Roosevelt Contrasted to Churchill as Leaders During World War 2. Roosevelt's usual hands-off approach as Commander-in-Chief was unlike his restless friend Churchill's approach. Churchill could not refrain from meddling with the British commanders in the matters of tactics and strategy. It should be noted here that, for all his greatness, Churchill's meddling did not always have a happy ending as he often wanted to move the allied thrusts to obscure (e.g., invade the ""soft underbelly of Europe"") theaters away from the primary theater. At these times, he sometimes seemed to act as a child playing with his toys. He had had the same problem in World War I when he initiated the doomed attack on Galipoli, Turkey, a disaster which cost him his position. He was almost - but not quiet - as bad a meddler with the military leaders as Hitler was on the German side. Roosevelt and Churchill had much different personalities. Roosevelt was a very political man, a man who used his charm, a compromisor, and a man who tried to avoid any controversy. His approach was always the indirect approach. (Had Roosevelt been a military man, he would have followed the ""indirect approach"" of Liddell Hart.) And by no means was Roosevelt an open man. He did not easily reveal his reasons for making decisions so his subordinates constantly had to try to read his mind and it did not appear to bother him at all to keep them guessing. The Bronx political leader, Edward Flynn, once observed of Roosevelt, ""Roosevelt would adopt ideas only if he believed in them. If he disagreed, he simply did nothing. ""Churchill, on the other hand, had a very opposite personality. His was the direct approach. He loved controversy and debate. He presented his ideas openly and loudly with much documentation and with great fervor. His associates and critics alike were allowed to do the same. He was an 'open read'. You always knew where Churchill stood on an issue. Because of his pugnacious disposition, Churchill was always getting knocked about by someone and had often, in his career, lost whatever job he might have at the time. But he had great tenacity and always got back on his feet full of fight. Such different men!.... but together, they made a great team. They, along with Stalin, ran World War and won it. The World War 2 Conferences. A number of conferences were held between Roosevelt and Churchill during World War 2. The Casablanca Conference between Roosevelt and Churchill was one of the more important conferences. A decision was made at this conference that no peace would be concluded with the Axis except on the basis of ""unconditional surrender."" This was done partly to placate the always suspicious Soviets that America and Britain would not seek a separate peace with Germany leaving the Soviets ""holding the bag."" Some critics say that this action unnecessarily lengthened World War 2 and caused unnecessary casualties. Politically, though, it was probably necessary. Two of the last conferences were held at Teheran and Yalta and included Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. Here the long range objectives of the United States and Britain began to deviate and some strain began to show on the friendship of Roosevelt and Churchill. Churchill had been looking ahead to the post-World War 2 period and had perceived that the Soviet Union was going to be a problem with its expansive goals and its communistic ideology. Roosevelt was less concerned about the Russians. He was more concerned about America getting caught up in the rebuilding of Europe and the possibility that they might have to station troops there indefinitely. He apparently felt that Americans would revert to their isolationists ways after the war and he had to get the country out of Europe as soon as possible. He also accepted the idea that Russia would have an expanded role in Europe after the war. Critics have long criticized Roosevelt in this aspect of his policy. To some, he sold out to the Soviets. To others, he was so anxious to end the war fast and get out of Europe that he ignored long-range political aspects which make up so large a part of war. There is no doubt that the rapidly deteriorating health of President Roosevelt's health affected his performance during the last months of his life and contributed to his weakness regarding the Russians during the last two conferences. President Roosevelt's Death. President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, a little over two weeks before the death of Hitler and a month before Germany surrendered and the European part of World War 2 ended. After his death, Churchill wrote Eleanor: ""I have lost a dear and cherished friendship which was forged in the fire of war. ""Overall, Roosevelt was a wonderful leader for America. He pulled us through both the great depression of the 30s and the World War 2. He made his share of mistakes. For example, there is no doubt that he waffled on the Jewish problem even as news of German atrocities toward the Jews began to be publicized. However, when you look at how the other American leaders have handled different crisis in the twentieth century, he was, in my opinion, clearly superior to all the others.

D2342771	http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-4-best-strategies-for-dealing-with-customer-service-2014-08-14	The 4 best strategies for dealing with customer service	Shutterstock.com / wavebreakmedia If you want your cable company, airline or pretty much any other company to resolve your complaints quickly and completely, you may need to change the way you deal with customer service. According to the latest data from the American Customer Service Index, Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with the companies they deal with. In the first quarter of 2014, overall customer satisfaction scores across all industries fell to 76.2 out of 100, which the researchers who compile the ratings say was “one of the largest [drops] in the 20-year history of the Index.” And some industries are particularly hated: Internet (63 out of 100) and cable and subscription TV (65) companies and airlines (69) rank at the bottom when it comes to customer satisfaction. Part of the dissatisfaction may be because we are interacting with customer service the wrong way. A report released Wednesday by customer-service software firm Zendesk, which looked at customer-service interactions from more than 25,000 companies across 140 countries, as well as insight from customer-service experts, found that some consumers are acting in ways that aren’t yielding them good results. Here are four strategies to employ when dealing with customer service. Don’t be too stern Being “overbearing” or “overly stern” is “a common strategy for some customers seeking better service,” the Zendesk survey revealed. “However, the data indicates that customers who are polite tend to submit higher customer satisfaction scores than those who aren’t.” Indeed, customers who ask the customer service rep to “please” help them with their request, and who said “thank you” for help they received throughout the call reported that they got better customer service than those who did not use these words, the survey showed. Of course, it could be that people who use these words tend to be more satisfied anyway. But there’s a strong chance that saying these platitudes ingratiates the customer service rep to you -- making them more willing to help you quickly and kindly with your request, experts say. “If you can find any excuse at all to praise them and build them up -- ‘you’re very good at what you do,’ ‘I really appreciate the extra effort,’ — people will almost always bend over backwards to maintain that good opinion and to show you just how good they really are,” says Barry Maher, the author of “Filling the Glass,” which focuses in part on getting better customer service and on personal empowerment. “Treat people well who aren’t used to being treated well…and you may well be astonished by the results you get.” Chip Bell, the founder of business consulting firm Chip Bell Group and author of “The 9 1/2 Principles of Innovative Service” adds that “you don’t have to be from the South to show respect with a liberal amount of ‘sir’ and ‘ma’am — it will open doors otherwise closed.”At the very least, “don’t go in guns a’ blazing,” says Shep Hyken, author of “Amaze Every Customer Every Time.” “The moment you lose your cool is the moment you lose control.” And, if that kindness does not work — rather than starting to get nasty — simply ask to speak to a higher authority, says Maher. Take notes Take a lesson from Rich Davis, the Comcast customer who recorded his call with the company and saw it go viral: It often pays to have good records of the antics a company is up to if you want to get your way down the road. “Have you ever heard a recording when you call for assistance that stated, ‘be advised this call may be recorded for quality assurance,’?” says motivational coach and speaker Chantay Bridges. “Flip the script, let the rep know: you are documenting them and keeping a record, that their service is also being noted.” While few customers keep detailed notes or recordings of their interactions, experts say, this will help them should there be a problem down the road, as they’ll have proof of what went on. Don’t keep your problems to yourself Most customers know that they should contact customer service via multiple channels like phone, email and social media to get their complaint resolved ASAP. But few take the logical next step: contacting competitors via these channels too to explain how their current company is not serving their needs. “If you receive a response from a competitor, watch or ask for a counter from the business you originally were contacting,” says John Huehn, CEO of In the Chat, which provides social media and text messaging platforms to enhance customer service. This could provide you with the leverage you need to get your issue resolved. It’s OK to keep it brief When it comes to email complaints, longer isn’t better, so don’t waste your breath (you might, after all, need that energy for dealing with the company later on). While experts often advise consumers to give customer service reps as many details as possible so they can effectively fix the customer’s complaint, customers who wrote long emails didn’t report getting any better customer service than those who wrote short ones, the Zendesk survey revealed. Indeed, the customer’s satisfaction levels at the end of the exchange were roughly the same whether they wrote 50 words or 200 words. Jason Maynard, product manager and data science lead at Zendesk, says that this doesn’t mean you should not include detail (indeed, that helps) but that you should make this detail as succinct as possible; if you have a complicated problem or request, you may want to consider calling, as most of us aren’t trained as technical writers.

D3085586	http://www.boral.com.au/concrete/diy/step4-formwork.asp	DIY Concrete Guide: Step 4 â Cut & Place Formwork	"What is ""Formwork""? Formwork is the walls that support the concrete until its set. It forms a mould. The best material for formwork is timber at least 25mm thick and equal in width to the concrete thickness. Formwork for Concrete Paths Use structural plywood or hardboard. For curved paths, hardboard or 7mm plywood is suitable but requires more supporting pegs. Forms must be strong, smooth on the top edge and well supported with stout pegs. (A good test for the strength of formwork is its ability to withstand a reasonable kick). Formwork must be deep enough to hold the thickness of concrete placed and to prevent slurry escaping underneath. Plywood Formwork Plywood formwork from your local building supply or timber yard is easy to cut to shape and can be reused for several jobs. You can cut enough formwork from a standard 2440mm x 1220mm sheet to make a path 1 metre wide and about 10 metres long. Place the forms along the borders marked out with string.2) Secure forms in position with stout pegs driven into the ground inside and outside the forms. The outside pegs should be placed at more frequent intervals and the forms nailed to them. Hammer the pegs down to below the height of the forms. Coat the formwork lightly with thin oil or form oil to be removed easily later. Soak the ground and forms thoroughly with water - the night before the pour. Dampen again before the Boral Concrete truck arrives. The ground should be damp but not muddy. Place reinforcement (check if required)Areas like garage floors require reinforcing with mesh or similar. Local building regulations sometimes demand the use of reinforcement. For information on what types of mesh to use and how to cut and place it, contact one of the steel fabric mesh suppliers eg. Bluescope Steel. Check your measurements Once you’ve got the formwork sorted and a few other preparations are complete, do one final check on the quantity of concrete you require. IMPORTANT! Check the THICKNESS. Remember - if your slab has an average thickness of 10% more than your original measurements you will need at least 10% more concrete to complete your job. > Step 5 – Placing the Concrete> Back to DIY Concrete steps> Safety Advice "

D2883971	https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/incontinence	Urinary Incontinence	"At least 10 million Americans suffer from incontinence, which means that they are not able to control the times when they urinate. In some cases, the loss of urine is so small that people are hardly aware of it. In other cases, the amount of leakage is quite large. Only about 10 percent of people who suffer from incontinence seek treatment. Without treatment, many of these people stay at home and withdraw from life unnecessarily. Incontinence is not a disease, but it can be a symptom of disease. Is urinary incontinence caused by aging? Incontinence occurs in all age groups but is most common in the elderly. It is the most common reason for people going into nursing homes. Does pregnancy cause urinary incontinence? Pregnant women may have a small amount of urine leakage due to the pressure of the baby against the bladder and the muscles that support it. Usually, this leakage occurs when the woman coughs or sneezes. The problem generally goes away within three or four months after the baby is born. It is helpful if the woman does exercises, called Kegel exercises, to strengthen the muscles. Sometimes, women who have had children are more likely to develop incontinence when they get older due to weakening of the muscles that support the bladder. This is sometimes treated by medications, but surgery may be needed in some cases. Which diseases can cause incontinence? Diabetes, strokes and nerve diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. These diseases can damage the nerves that control the bladder which is where urine is stored before it leaves the body. These diseases can also weaken the ""sphincter,"" a ring of muscle around the opening of the bladder. This ring usually keeps urine from leaking out. Men can have incontinence from problems such as overgrowth of the prostate gland or cancer of the prostate gland, both of which can block the flow of urine. In these cases, urine leaks out when the bladder becomes too full. How can I tell if I have urinary incontinence? If you are having urine leakage, you should seek medical care to find out the cause. The doctor will ask you about your medical history and order laboratory tests. The doctor will also examine you. Sometimes, special tests may be done. In one of these, the bladder is filled with fluid. You will then be asked to repeat the action that usually causes you to have urine leakage, such as coughing or straining. X-rays and other measurements are then done to help the doctor find out why you are having the urine leakage. Are there any treatments? Yes. Urine leakage can often be stopped or lessened after the doctor finds the cause. Some treatments that have helped other people include drugs, behavioral therapy, special exercises, biofeedback, electrical stimulation and surgery. DRUGS: Several drugs are available for treating incontinence, depending on what is causing your problem. Some of these drugs, called ""bladder relaxants,"" prevent urine leakage by decreasing bladder contractions. Another type of drug helps some kinds of incontinence by strengthening muscle contractions at the outlet of the bladder. Estrogens also have been helpful for some women after menopause. A nasal spray that causes you to make less urine is also used for day and nighttime urine leakage (bed-wetting). BEHAVIORAL THERAPY: You can work with a specially trained therapist who will help you to control your urine leakage. EXERCISE: You can learn to do special exercises to strengthen the muscles that prevent leakage of urine from the bladder. BIOFEEDBACK: These techniques also help you to gain control over your bladder and to strengthen the sphincter muscle. ELECTRICAL STIMULATION: This method can help you to strengthen your sphincter muscle and keep your bladder from contracting when you do not want this to happen. SURGERY: Usually, your doctor will first try medical treatments such as drugs, biofeedback, etc. If these do not work, surgery may be planned. Some types of urinary incontinence due to weakness of the sphincter can be corrected by strengthening the muscle with surgery. A newer technique involves injecting collagen (a protein material) around the urethra to support and compress the sphincter muscle. What if these treatments do not work? These treatments should bring relief to most people who have urinary incontinence. However, if the treatments do not work for you, many absorbent protective pads are available to use. In men, a special sheath, known as a condom catheter, may be worn around the penis to drain the urine into a bag. Sometimes, a tube called an in-dwelling catheter may be placed into the bladder to drain urine continuously. This method can cause problems, such as infections, and should be used only in special cases as a permanent form of treatment. Another approach is to use a catheter several times a day to drain the bladder. Will incontinence prevent me from being active sexually? Not necessarily. Often, there is no physical reason why a person with incontinence cannot be sexually active. However, some of the diseases that cause incontinence, such as multiple sclerosis and diabetes, also may decrease the ability to perform sexually. "
D1911483	https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/mdo/presentation/conditions/condition_viewall_page.jsp?condition=Condition_Abnormal_Vaginal_Bleeding_in_Midlife_and_Beyond_-_Ob_Gyn.xml	My Doctor Online The Permanente Medical Group	Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding in Midlife and Beyond Overview Women of any age can have abnormal vaginal bleeding (irregular menstrual periods). Abnormal bleeding can also come from the uterus and other organs in the pelvis. During midlife, women’s hormone levels slowly decrease. This normal change can cause irregular bleeding. Usually this type of bleeding stops around the time a woman has her final period (menopause). Abnormal vaginal bleeding can also be caused by: Infection of the vagina or uterus Urinary tract infection Other medical conditions Uterine fibroids Growths in the pelvic organs, including cancer Also, some medications may affect vaginal bleeding. Call us to schedule an exam if you have vaginal bleeding that: Is heavier or lasts longer than usual. Occurs after you’ve completed menopause (12 months of no periods). Treatment is based on the cause of your vaginal bleeding. It may include medication, nonsurgical procedures, and surgery. Causes Changes in your bleeding patterns are normal during midlife stages. Perimenopause Perimenopause is the time period before your menstrual cycle ends. Usually it begins several years before menopause. For some women, it starts as early as their mid-30s or early 40s. There’s no way to tell how long perimenopause will last. You may be in perimenopause if your periods are: Irregular, with longer or shorter cycles (time between periods). Lighter or heavier than has been usual for you. Irregular periods occur when you’re no longer ovulating (releasing an egg) every month. Menopause When you have not had a menstrual period for 12 months in a row, you’ve completed menopause. Menopause usually happens several years after you first have perimenopause symptoms. If you have vaginal bleeding after menopause, call us to schedule an exam. Symptoms and Diagnosis Unusual bleeding from the uterus that is not due to growths (fibroids or polyps) is called dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). Bleeding can be heavy or light. During perimenopause, it’s usually due to natural changes, including: Changes in hormone levels No ovulation (anovulation)To find out what’s causing DUB, we may: Perform a pelvic exam. Do blood and urine tests. Check a tissue sample (biopsy). Related Conditions Abnormal bleeding can also result from this range of medical conditions. Infections of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries can include: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)Genital warts on the vulva or in the vagina Urinary tract infection (UTI) can cause bleeding from the bladder. UTI or bladder infection symptoms include: Pink or light-brown urine Blood in the urine Pain when urinating Frequent need to urinate Thyroid problems occur especially in women over 40. An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can cause heavy and prolonged vaginal bleeding. An overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) can cause unusual bleeding. A noncancerous growth in the pituitary gland (prolactinoma) can cause abnormal bleeding. The pituitary gland at the base of your brain produces hormones, including prolactin. Cushing’s syndrome is caused by a growth in the pituitary gland. It causes high levels of cortisol in the blood. Cortisol is a hormone that helps your body respond to stress. Vaginal dryness, a common symptom of menopause, can cause bleeding during sex with intercourse. Other Causes Growths in one of the pelvic organs can cause unusual bleeding. Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths in the wall of the uterus. Fibroids can be as small as a seed or as large as a grapefruit. They can grow as a single tumor or in several places. Women are most likely to have fibroids in midlife. Sometimes they occur in younger women. Fibroids may cause no symptoms. Or they may cause: Periods to occur more often Menstrual cramps Back pain Problems with bowel movements or urination Pain during intercourse A cervical polyp is a small fingerlike growth on the cervix or in the uterus. We sometimes find cervical polyps during a pelvic exam. They are usually noncancerous (benign). Hormone-producing tumors are growths that can change your menstrual cycles. We diagnose such tumors using: Physical exam Blood tests Ultrasound exam Cancers of the uterus, cervix, and vagina are serious diseases. Be sure to be screened regularly by your doctor for these conditions. Hemorrhoids Bleeding from hemorrhoids can be mistaken for vaginal bleeding. Hemorrhoids occur when the veins around your bottom (rectum and anus) swell and bleed. Hemorrhoids cause: Itching Pain A hard lump around the anus Hemorrhoids usually go away within a few days. Let us know if you have a hemorrhoid that does not heal. Injury or trauma The genital area may be injured and bleed during: Sex Tampon insertion Strenuous exercise If a tampon or other object is left in your vagina, it can cause irregular bleeding. We can check for these injuries by giving you a pelvic exam. Medications That May Affect Bleeding Many medications can cause unusual vaginal bleeding. You might have: Lighter or heavier periods Less or more frequent bleeding Skipped periods Medications that can change your regular bleeding pattern include: Aspirin and other anticoagulant medicines (Coumadin)Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ibuprofen)Birth control pills Birth control injections (Depo-Provera)Contraceptive implants (Implanon)IUD (Mirena intrauterine device)Hormone therapy Medications for other conditions that can affect your bleeding patterns include: Psychiatric medications, such as antidepressants Seizure medications (Dilantin)Corticosteroids (Prednisone)Medicines to prevent organ transplant rejection Chemotherapy for cancer (Cytoxan or tamoxifen)Radiation therapy Thyroid medicines (Synthroid, Levothroid)If you think your menstrual bleeding changes may be related to medication, let us know. If the medication you’re taking has not been prescribed by a doctor, stop taking it and call us. Help for Partner Abuse Unfortunately, abusive relationships are common. Abuse can be physical, sexual, or psychological harm. It may include pressuring or forcing you to have sex or do things you are not comfortable with or refusing to use a condom to protect against pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

D1281784	http://www.amisinsurance.com/content/subrogation_information_article.php	What is Subrogation and why is it important?	Subrogation is the act of one party claiming the legal rights of another that it has reimbursed for losses. Subrogation occurs in property/casualty insurance when a company pays one of its insured’s for damages, then makes its own claim against others who may have caused the loss, insured the loss, or contributed to it. For Example: Suppose another driver runs a red light and your car is totaled. You have insurance on your car, so you call your insurance carrier and they pay you for all of your expenses related to the accident. Your insurance company, realizing that the other driver had an insurance policy, then seeks reimbursement from the at-fault party’s insurance carrier. Your insurer is “subrogated” to the rights of your policy and can “step in your shoes” to recover any amount paid out on your behalf. This is the definition of subrogation. Policy Types Subrogation can apply to all different types of policies, personal and business related. Example : Suppose your child starts a fire at their school causing $6,000.00 in damages. The juvenile court orders you to pay for the damages to the school. You might have coverage for this incident under the negligent supervision clause of your homeowner’s insurance policy. You should contact them immediately to find out if coverage applies. What if you arrive at your business and discover it is destroyed by fire caused by a defective copier that you purchased. Your insurance company would pay the claim and then subrogate against the manufacturer of the copier to recover the expenses paid out. Most insurance companies would attempt to recover any out-of- pocket expense you might incur as well. Why it is important to you Why is subrogation becoming so important in the insurance industry and how can it benefit you, the policyholder? Subrogation is important because any monies recovered through the subrogation process go directly to the insurance company’s bottom line. The benefits of subrogation have been demonstrated in company performance. This is according to the Ward Financial Group, a firm that researches property/casualty operations and identifies operational benchmarks that distinguish high performing companies. According to a study by Ward, companies that achieved superior operating results subrogated claims at about twice the rate of average companies and recovered substantially higher percentages of their loss payments through subrogation. A company with an effective subrogation department can offer lower premiums to their policyholders.

Are there other reasons to do a lumbar puncture? Why do I need a spinal tap? Why can't my blood or urine be tested? What other tests may be done in addition to CSF analysis?1. What is a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and how is it performed? The lumbar puncture is usually performed while you are lying on your side in a curled up fetal position but may sometimes be performed in a sitting position. It is important that you remain still during the procedure. Once you are in the correct position, your back is cleaned with an antiseptic and a local anesthetic is injected under the skin. When the area has become numb, a special needle is inserted through the skin, between two vertebrae, and into your spinal canal. An ""opening"" or initial pressure reading of the CSF is obtained. The health practitioner then collects a small amount of CSF in multiple sterile vials. A ""closing"" pressure is obtained, the needle is withdrawn, and a sterile dressing and pressure are applied to the puncture site. You will then be asked to lie quietly in a flat position, without lifting your head, for one or more hours to avoid a potential post-test headache. The lumbar puncture procedure usually takes less than half an hour. For most patients, it is a moderately uncomfortable procedure. The most common sensation is a feeling of pressure when the needle is introduced. Let your healthcare provider know if you experience a headache or any abnormal sensations, such as pain, numbness, or tingling in your legs, or pain at the puncture site. The lumbar puncture is performed low in the back, well below the end of the spinal cord. There are spinal nerves in the location sampled, but they have room to move away from the needle. There is the potential for the needle to contact a small vein on the way in. This can cause a ""traumatic tap,"" which just means that a small amount of blood may leak into one or more of the samples collected. While this is not ideal, it may happen a certain percentage of the time. The evaluation of your results will take this into account.^ Back to top2. Are there other reasons to do a lumbar puncture? Yes. Sometimes it will be performed to introduce anesthetics or medications into the CSF. Repeated punctures are sometimes used to decrease CSF pressure.^ Back to top3. Why do I need a spinal tap? Why can't my blood or urine be tested? Spinal fluid, obtained during a spinal tap, is often the best sample to use for conditions affecting your central nervous system because your CSF surrounds your brain and spinal cord. Changes in the elements of your CSF due to central nervous system diseases or other serious conditions are often first and most easily detected in a sample of your spinal fluid. Tests on blood and urine may be used in conjunction with CSF analysis to evaluate your condition.^ Back to top4. What other tests may be done in addition to CSF analysis? Other laboratory tests that may be ordered along with or following CSF testing include:• Blood culture to detect and identify bacteria in the blood• Cultures of other parts of the body to detect the source of the infection that led to meningitis or encephalitis• Blood glucose, total protein to compare with the concentration of CSF glucose and protein• CBC (complete blood count) to evaluate cell counts in blood• Antibodies for a variety of viruses, such as West Nile Virus• ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein), for indication of inflammation• CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel), a group of tests used to evaluate electrolyte balance and organ function^ Back to top "

D207561	https://www.thoughtco.com/is-taiwan-a-country-1435437	Is Taiwan a Country?	"Humanities ›Geography Is Taiwan a Country? On Which of the Eight Criteria Does It Fail? Share Flipboard Email Print Peace Park in Taipei, Taiwan. (Photo by Daniel Aguilera / Contributor / Getty Images)by Matt Rosenberg Updated January 25, 2018There are eight accepted criteria used to determine whether a place is an independent country (also known as a State with a capital ""s"") or not. Let us examine these eight criteria in regard to Taiwan, an island (approximately the size of the U. S. states of Maryland and Delaware combined) located across the Taiwan Strait from mainland China (the People's Republic of China). Taiwan developed into its modern situation following the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949 when two million Chinese Nationalists fled to Taiwan and established a government for all of China on the island. From that point and until 1971, Taiwan was recognized as ""China"" in the United Nations. Mainland China's position on Taiwan is that there is only one China and that Taiwan is part of China; the People's Republic of China is awaiting reunification of the island and mainland. However, Taiwan claims independence as a distinct State. We will now determine which is the case. Has Space or Territory That Has Internationally Recognized Boundaries (Boundary Disputes Are OK)Somewhat. Due to political pressure from mainland China, the United States, and most other significant nations recognize one China and thus include the boundaries of Taiwan as being part of the boundaries of China. Has People Who Live There on an Ongoing Basis Absolutely! Taiwan is home to almost 23 million people, making it the 48th largest ""country"" in the world, with a population slightly smaller than North Korea but larger than Romania. Has Economic Activity and an Organized Economy Absolutely! Taiwan is an economic powerhouse - it's one of the four economic tigers of Southeast Asia. Its GDP per capita is among the top 30 of the world. Taiwan has its own currency, the new Taiwan dollar. Has the Power of Social Engineering, Such as Education Absolutely!Education is compulsory and Taiwan has more than 150 institutions of higher learning. Taiwan is home to the Palace Museum, which houses over 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and porcelain. Has a Transportation System for Moving Goods and People Absolutely! Taiwan has an extensive internal and external transportation network that consists of roads, highways, pipelines, railroads, airports, and seaports. Taiwan can ship goods, there's no question about that!Has a Government That Provides Public Services and Police Power Absolutely! Taiwan has multiple branches of the military - Army, Navy (including Marine Corps), Air Force, Coast Guard Administration, Armed Forces Reserve Command, Combined Service Forces Command, and Armed Forces Police Command. There are almost 400,000 active-duty members of the military and the country spends about 15-16% of its budget on defense. Taiwan's main threat is from mainland China, which has approved an anti-secession law that allows a military attack on Taiwan to prevent the island from seeking independence. Additionally, the United States sells Taiwan military equipment and may defend Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act. Has Sovereignty - No Other State Should Have Power Over the Country's Territory Mostly. While Taiwan has maintained its own control over the island from Taipei since 1949, China still claims to have control over Taiwan. Has External Recognition - A Country Has Been ""Voted into the Club"" by Other Countries Somewhat. Since China claims Taiwan as its province, the international community does not want to contradict China on this matter. Thus, Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations. Plus, only 25 countries (as of early 2007) recognize Taiwan as an independent country and they recognize it as the ""only"" China. Due to this political pressure from China, Taiwan does not maintain an embassy in the United States and the United States (among most other countries) has not recognized Taiwan since January 1, 1979. However, many countries have set up unofficial organizations to carry out commercial and other relations with Taiwan. Taiwan is represented in 122 countries unofficially. Taiwan maintains contact with the United States through two through an unofficial instrumentality - American Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office. In addition, Taiwan issues globally recognized passports that allow its citizens to travel internationally. Taiwan also is a member of the International Olympic Committee and this sends its own team to the Olympic Games. Recently, Taiwan has lobbied strongly for admission into international organizations such as the United Nations, which mainland China opposes. Therefore, Taiwan only meets five of the eight criteria fully. Another three criteria are met in some respects due to mainland China's stance on the issue. In conclusion, despite the controversy surrounding the island of Taiwan, its status should be considered as a de facto independent country of the world.cite "

Because of this, this article can only provide information on on fragile areas that we'll call vulnerable points.

When using these pressure points one must be particularly careful as it is easy to kill someone accidentally, such as a friend or even an enemy. At that point, you enter the legal system, which generally does not know if you were really defending yourself or were actually the aggressor, and in some cases, that may not even matter. This leads to the point that, more important than the technique, is the mindset that you use in training, which is, of course a personal philosophical decision, but one which requires much thought and consideration of when what you practice must be put to use.

D488904	https://www.mathworks.com/help/map/ref/axesm.html	axesm	axesm Create map axescollapse all in page The axesm function creates a map axes into which both vector and raster geographic data can be projected using functions such as plotm and geoshow. Properties specific to map axes can be assigned upon creation with axesm, and for an existing map axes they can be queried and changed using getm and setm. Use the standard get and set methods to query and control the standard MATLAB ® axes properties of a map axes. Map axes are standard MATLAB axes with different default settings for some properties and a MATLAB structure for storing projection parameters and other data. The main differences in default settings are: Axes properties XGrid, YGrid , XTick, YTick are set to 'off'. The hold mode is 'on'. The map projection structure stores the map axes properties, which, in addition to the special standard axes settings, allow Mapping Toolbox™ functions to recognize an axes or an opened FIG-file as a map axes. See Map Axes Properties for descriptions of the map axes properties. Syntaxaxesmaxesm (Name,Value)axesm (projid,Name,Value)Descriptionaxesm with no input arguments, initiates the axesmui map axes graphical user interface, which can be used to set map axes properties. This is detailed on the axesmui reference page.axesm ( Name,Value) creates a map axes and modifies the map axes appearance using name-value pairs to set properties. You can specify multiple name-value pairs. Enclose each property name in quotes. For example, 'Font Size',14 sets the font size for the map axes text. Properties may be specified in any order, but the Map Projection property must be included. For a full list of properties, see Map Axes Properties.axesm ( projid, Name,Value) specifies which map projection to use. projid should match one of the entries in the last column displayed by the maps function. You can also find these listed in Summary and Guide to Projections. Examples Create Map Axes for Mercator Projection Create map axes for a Mercator projection, with selected latitude limits:axesm ( 'Map Projection', 'mercator', 'Map Lat Limit' , [-70 80])In the preceding example, all properties not explicitly addressed in the call are set to either fixed or calculated defaults. The file mercator.m defines a projection function, so the same result could have been achieved with the functionaxesm ( 'mercator', 'Map Lat Limit' , [-70 80])Each projection function includes default values for all properties. Any following property name/property value pairs are treated as overrides. In either of the above examples, data displayed in the given map axes is in a Mercator projection. Any data falling outside the prescribed limits is not displayed. Input Argumentscollapse allprojid — Map projection IDcharacter vector | string scalar Map projection ID, specified as a string scalar or character vector. projid should match one of the entries in the last column displayed by the maps function. You can also find these listed in Summary and Guide to Projections. Note The names of projection files are case sensitive. The projection files included in Mapping Toolbox software use only lowercase letters and Arabic numerals. Example: 'eqdcylin'Name-Value Pair Arguments Specify optional comma-separated pairs of Name,Value arguments. Name is the argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name must appear inside single quotes ( ' ' ). You can specify several name and value pair arguments in any order as Name1,Value1,...,Name N,Value N. Example: axesm ('Map Projection','pcarree','Frame','on') creates a map axes with a Plate Carree projection, and makes the map frame visible. Note The properties listed here are only a subset. For a full list, see Map Axes Properties.collapse all'Map Projection' — Map projectioncharacter vector | string scalar Map projection, specified as a string scalar or character vector. Map Projection sets the projection, and hence all transformation calculations, for the map axes object. It must be a member of the recognized projection set, which you can list by typing getm ('Map Projection') or maps . For more information on projections, see the Mapping Toolbox User's Guide. Some projections set their own defaults for other properties, such as parallels and trim limits. 'Map Lat Limit' — Geographic latitude limits of the display areatwo-element vector Geographic latitude limits of the display area, specified as a two-element vector of the form [southern_limit northern_limit]. This property can be set for many typical projections and geometries, but cannot be used with oblique projections or with globe, for example. When applicable, the Map Lat Limit property may affect the origin latitude if the Origin property is not set explicitly when calling axesm. It may also determine the value used for FLat Limit. See Access and Change Map Axes Properties for a more complete description of the applicability of Map Lat Limit and its interaction with the origin, frame limits, and other properties. 'Map Lon Limit' — Geographic longitude limits of the display areatwo-element vector Geographic longitude limits of the display area, specified as a two-element vector of the form [western_limit eastern_limit]. This property can be set for many typical projections and geometries, but cannot be used with oblique projections or with globe, for example. When applicable, the Map Lon Limit property may affect the origin longitude if the Origin property is not set explicitly when calling axesm. It may also determine the value used for FLon Limit. See Access and Change Map Axes Properties for a more complete description of the applicability of Map Lon Limit and its interaction with the origin, frame limits, and other properties. Tips In general, after re-opening a saved figure that contains a map axes, you should not attempt to modify the projection properties of that map axes. When you create a map axes with axesm and right click in the axes, a context menu appears. If you do not need the menu or it interferes with your application, you can disable it by resetting the 'Button Down Fcn' property of the axes:ax = axesm ( 'mercator' ); % Right-clicking brings up context menu. set (ax, 'Button Down Fcn' , []) % Context menu has been disabled.

D205553	http://health-care-tips.org/diseases/pharyngitis.htm	Pharyngitis - Causes, Symptoms and Treatments	Pharyngitis - Causes, Symptoms and Treatments The most common throat disorder, pharyngitis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the pharynx. It is widespread among adults who live or work industy or very dry environments, use their voices excessively, habitually use tobacco or alcohol, or suffer from chronic sinusitis, persistent coughs, or allergies. Causes of Pharyngitis: Pharyngitis is usually caused by respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza viruses. The most common concern is infection due to group A betahemolytic streptococci, because of the associated, preventable risk of rheumatic fever. Other common causes include Mycoplasma and Chlamydia. A host of other bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spirochetes have also been identified as etiologic agents. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a rare cause of pharyngitis. Signs and symptoms of Pharyngitis: Pharyngitis produces a sore throat and slight difficulty in swallowing. Swallowing saliva is usually more painful than swallowing food. Pharyngitis may also cause the sensation of a lump in the throat as well as a constant, aggravating urge to swallow. Associated features may include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, coryza, and rhinorrhea. Inquire about drooling, any preferred neck position, and pain on extension of the neck. Uncomplicated pharyngitis usually subsides in 3 to 10 days. Diagnosis of Pharyngitis: Physical examination of the pharynx reveals generalized redness and inflammation of the posterior wall and red, edematous mucous membranes studded with white or yellow exudate. Exudate is usually confined to the lymphoid areas of the throat, sparing the tonsillar pillars. Bacterial pharyngitis usually produces a large amount of exudate. Assess for anterior vs. posterior cervical adenopathy, gingivitis or necrotic tonsillar ulcers. Associated physical findings, such as viral exanthem, conjunctivitis, petechiae, generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or hepatic tenderness, may provide important clues to etiology. Treatment of Pharyngitis: There are several approaches to the management of pharyngitis. Deciding factors include the reliability of cultures and rapid tests for streptococci, the incidence of pharyngitis not due to group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, patient followup, medical compliance, and costs. In acute viral pharyngitis, treatment is usually symptomatic, and consists mainly of rest, warm saline gargles, throat lozenges containing a mild anesthetic, plenty of fluids, and analgesics as needed. If the patient can't swallow fluids, hospitalization may be required for I. V. hydration. Suspected bacterial pharyngitis requires rigorous treatment with penicillin or another broad-spectrum antibiotic because Streptococcus is the chief infecting microbe. Antibiotic therapy should continue for 48 hours until culture results are known. If the culture (or a rapid strep test) is positive for group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, or if bacterial infection is suspected despite negative culture results, penicillin therapy should be continued for 10 days. This is to prevent the sequelae of acute rheumatic fever. Erythromycin, amoxicillin, or penicillin are effective. Patients suspected of noncompliance may be given a long-acting parenteral penicillin such as benzathine penicillin. The macrolide antibiotics have also been reported to be successful in shorter-duration regimens. Azithromycin need only be taken for 3 days. Chronic pharyngitis requires the same supportive measures as acute pharyngitis but with greater emphasis on eliminating the underlying cause, such as an allergen. Preventive measures include adequate humidification and avoiding excessive exposure to air conditioning. In addition, the patient should be urged to stop smoking. Antibiotic choices for treatment failures are controversial. Alternatives to penicillin include cefuroxime and certain other cephalosporins, dicloxacillin, and amoxicillin with clavulanate. In cases of prior severe penicillin reaction, cephalosporins should probably be avoided. The cross reaction is believed to be higher than the overall 8% rate. Special considerations and Prevention tips of Pharyngitis:1. Administer analgesics and warm saline gargles as appropriate.2. Encourage the patient to drink plenty of fluids. Monitor intake and output scrupulously, and watch for signs of dehydration. Assess skin turgor, mucous membranes and, in young children, tearing.3. Provide meticulous mouth care to prevent dry lips and oral pyoderma, and maintain a restful environment.4. Elevate the patient's head with three or four pillows.5. Obtain throat cultures, and administer antibiotics as required if the patient has acute bacterial pharyngitis.6. Teach the patient with chronic pharyngitis how to minimize sources of throat irritation in the environment, such as using a bedside humidifier.7. Refer the patient to a self-help group to stop smoking, if appropriate.8. In severe cases, anesthetic gargles and lozenges (such as benzocaine) may provide additional symptomatic relief. Stress to patients the importance of completing the 10-day course of antibiotics regardless of symptom response. Patients are presumed to be noninfectious after 24 hours of antibiotic coverage.

D2702544	http://www.familybailbonds.com/blog/2011/09/what-happens-if-i-bail-someone-out-of-jail-and-they-skip-court/	What Happens if I Bail Someone Out of Jail and They Skip Court?	What Happens if I Bail Someone Out of Jail and They Skip Court? Bondsman Margie September 5, 2011 Ask the Bondsman, How Bail Bonds Work9 Flares Filament.io Made with Flare More Info When a friend or family member has been arrested, they may turn to you for help in posting their bail. If you agree to help them, you will have the option to either pay the full bail amount directly to the court or jail, or to use the services of a licensed bail bondsman. But be careful and fully consider the impact of signing a bail bond contract. When you sign a contract with a bail bond company, you become known as the indemnitor. This means that you are assuming responsibility to the court and the bailsman. The contract is a legally binding document. As the signer or co-signer of the contract, you are taking responsibility for the defendant to show up for each required court appearance. In most cases where the defendant fails to appear, it is a simple situation such as car trouble. Situations such as these can generally be resolved easily with a simple phone call. There are rare cases where the defendant decides not to go to court. If you have any reason to believe that the defendant will evade court, do yourself a favor and do not bail them out. Simply missing court is easy to deal with, but in cases where the defendant “goes on the run,” the headache, heartache and financial liability can be overwhelming. It is important for you to understand the bail bonds process and your responsibilities as an indemnitor before you enter into a bail bond contract on someone else’s behalf. As signer you are responsible for the defendant’s appearance at court. If the defendant willfully fails to appear in court, you are responsible to help the bondsman get the defendant back into court or jail. If it becomes necessary for the bail bond agent to apprehend the defendant because they refuse to go to court, the agent will use the services of a fugitive recovery person, or “bounty hunter.” In these circumstances, you as the indemnitor will be liable for paying any additional expenses that come from hiring a bounty hunter. In California, the bail bondsman generally has six months to locate and bring in the defendant. If the defendant is not apprehended in that time-fame, you will also be responsible for paying the full amount of the bond as well as any additional expenses and any unpaid premium. For example, if the bond for the defendant is $50,000 and the defendant fails to appear or is not brought in within the time allowed, the indemnitor will have to pay the $50,000 plus any fees the bondsman has incurred to locate the defendant. When it comes to bailing someone out of jail, before making what could be a very costly decision, think it over carefully. If you have any reason to believe that the defendant will refuse to appear in court once they’ve been released from jail, don’t arrange bail for them.

D1247413	http://www.findarthritistreatment.com/how-to-quickly-heal-a-pulled-muscle/	6 Ways To Quickly Heal A Pulled Muscle	6 Ways To Quickly Heal A Pulled Muscle If the muscle fiber is torn, it results in pulled muscle. A pulled muscle is generated when the individual has not done sufficient warm up exercise before starting any workout. If the person pushes the muscle too harder or if the muscle gets twisted into a wrong direction, it results in pulled muscle. The muscles that are commonly affected are hamstring and back muscles. Pulled muscle usually results when the person is doing strenuous work or extensive exercise. Due to continuous involvement in strenuous work outs and athletic events, athletes mostly suffer from pain due to pulled muscle. This article discusses about some of the healing methods that are established for pulled muscle. Methods to Heal a Pulled Muscle Apply an Ice Pack When the person encountered the pulled muscle, immediately the region swells. The swollen part can be soothened by applying an ice pack on the area. Instead of using ice directly on the swollen region, it is always safe to keep ice pack or cold pack. The national institute of Health has suggested that ice pack can be applied for about 10 to 15 minutes, once in every hour after the injury. From the second day of the injury, the frequency of the ice pack usage could be changed to once in three to four hours. It is also suggested to apply heat pack and ice pack alternately three days after the injury to bring relief to the pain due to pulled muscle. The heating bags can be used at the time of healing as they will help in improving the flexibility of the muscles and in allowing the muscles to regain their original form. Administration of Prescribed Medicine According to the prescription given by the doctor, the antibiotic dosages as well as pain killers have to be administered for the rapid healing of the injuries. Regular and periodical following of proper medicine is essential for the recovery of the pulled muscle. Bandage Wrapped A bandage that is elastic in nature has to be wrapped around the pulled muscle by compressing it. The bandage will help in reducing the swelling and in offering proper support as well. Also Read How To Prevent Muscle Strain Tips To Get Relief For Back Muscle Strain Causes And Types Of Musculoskeletal Pain Stretching Exercises The strained muscle has to be slowly and gently stretched. The stretching of the muscles will reduce the swelling very rapidly. The stretching exercises have to be done to make the muscles stronger such that they can be helpful in allowing the person to carry out the normal work. Relaxation and Rest to the Muscle The pulled muscle will be very much strained and hence should not bear any heavy burden. The muscle should not suffer from tiredness. Excessive energy and strength are necessary to make the muscle healthy and fit so that it can come to normal state. The pulled muscles must be relaxed and the person has to rest sufficiently to bring relief to the pain and heal faster. Warming Up Doing warm-ups before any workout is a very good habit for muscle slackening and calming down of muscles to some extent. The swelling of the pulled muscle can be reduced by elevating the leg or hand that has the injury. Adding Epsom salt to hot water and using the water for taking bath would speed up recovery of the pulled muscle.

D2111530	http://www.marijuanaandthelaw.com/marijuana-legalization/	Marijuana Legalization	Marijuana Legalization Marijuana legalization is sweeping the country. It has already spread to five states and the nation’s capital, and could be on its way to other places as well. So what exactly is marijuana legalization? How does it differ from other avenues of cannabis reform? How do states approach the cannabis issue? And what about the feds? Terminology is important, although it isn’t always used correctly. The distinctions between the different levels of marijuana reform are critical, as activities that pass legal scrutiny in one place may lead to fines or even jail time in another. What Is Marijuana Legalization? The legalization of marijuana means that, as long as you abide by the state-specific cannabis laws, you will not get arrested, fined or convicted for the use, possession and cultivation of marijuana. Legalization also allows a retail market to be established where people can purchase cannabis. Each state has different laws regarding the specifics of marijuana legalization, so make sure you are in the know. Where Is Marijuana Legal? Cannabis use has been “legalized” in five states – Oregon, Colorado, Washington, Alaska, and California – plus the District of Columbia. The drug has been “decriminalized” in 14 other states. And medical marijuana is allowed in 28. In the five states that have legalized, adults over 21 may now buy, use, and possess relatively small amounts of cannabis, usually no more than 2 ounces. In Washington, Colorado, Oregon and Alaska, the cultivation, processing, and retail sale of the drug is also currently allowed. Colorado – The Centennial State legalized medicinal use of marijuana in 2000 and recreational use in 2012. The state’s laws allow the possession, cultivation, use, commercial farming and retail sale of marijuana. Washington – While medical marijuana has been available in Washington state since before the turn of the century, recreational marijuana use of legalized in 2012. The state’s first cannabis retail stores opened July 2014. Oregon – The Beaver State legalized the recreational possession, use and cultivation of marijuana at the ballot in 2014. Medical marijuana has been allowed in the state since 1998. Judging by the smooth implementation of legalization, it appears that Oregon learned from the two states to legalize before it. Alaska – Alaska also legalized the medicinal use of marijuana back in 1998, and the state’s voters opted to legalize the drug for recreational use in 2014. District of Columbia – Marijuana was legalized in D. C. by ballot initiative in 2014, shortly after the drug became decriminalized . The future of legalization in the District remains uncertain, however, as the purchase and sale of cannabis remains illegal. California – Voters in California legalized the recreational use of marijuana in 2016 by approving Prop 64., also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA). Residents in the Golden State can now possess up to 1 ounce of cannabis without penalty, and grow up to six plants at home. Legalization vs. Decriminalization Journalists often use the terms “legalization” and “decriminalization” interchangeably. Technically they’re right, since both approaches remove criminal penalties. True legalization means that a state allows a full legal marijuana industry where adults can buy, possess, and use the drug freely. Laws against public consumption and high driving still apply, but enforcement is typically lighter in these states. But there are two big practical differences. For one thing, states that decriminalize still penalize those caught carrying marijuana, even if only with small fines. For another, these states don’t allow any kind of legal retail market for the drug. Growing, processing, shipping, or selling weed can be a felony in many of these places. In other words, “decriminalization” means you can’t go to jail for possession, but you can go to jail for selling, making, or transporting marijuana. Medical marijuana, on the other hand, is a legal system in which patients can get prescriptions for weed to treat their disorders. In most of these states, access is limited to patients who suffer from at least one of a short list of severe medical problems that can be alleviated with pot. These disorders can include glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, seizures, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), HIV/AIDS, cancer and nausea, among others. These laws don’t cover most other conditions, though that’s likely to change in coming years.

Actually there are somethings in English which haven't yet been named explicitly rather are known genuinely by the names which are precisely different, derived from other contexts or scenarios and also the one which sounds like this perfectly relates to them however they are not the ones that we often understand when hear or see and so is the case with these words pride, sault and troop. They all are different as well as mean different but it's the context, characteristics and classes that make the words perfect to be used in other cases as well. So other words could also be sault, troop etc. Or simply we can use a phrase to mean them ie ""a company of lions"".

D7792	http://drugdetection.net/drug.htm	.	"For information on drugs, we recommend you click on one of the following links, or view brief summaries of common drugs of abuse and drug testing: NHTSA Drugs and Human Performance Facts Sheets Medline Plus NIDA (National Institute of Drug Abuse)The California Department of Justice Toxicology (Cal DOJ Toxicology Laboratory). The detection times in urine are significantly greater than detection times in blood, which is also generally much more expensive. The presence of a drug or drugs in urine does not provide information as to whether the individual is actually under the influence at any particular time. Likewise, a urine drug concentration cannot be reliably correlated to blood concentration or dose. Blood testing, on the other hand may provide more suitable information about whether or not an individual is ""under the influence"", though this may not be conclusive in all cases. Urine drug testing accuracy is variable depending on how the testing is done. Drug testing is extremely accurate and reliable when all aspects of the testing process are done properly. On the other hand, the information obtained may be very misleading and inaccurate when poor procedures or testing methods are utilized. Drug testing will only be reliable when the consumer knows how it should be done and then demands from the industry that it is done properly. Unfortunately, today, the majority of drug testing is poorly done and plagued with unreliable information. Below are aspects that should provide enough information to empower the consumer to demand proper testing procedures. There are three aspects to reliable drug testing: Strict collection procedures;Proper Testing Procedures;Random notification. Specimen Collection: Collection of Urine should be done following a process of positive identification of the individual and full chain of custody procedures. In addition, and more importantly, the specimen should be certified by a means of temperature measurement with a digital thermometer. Acceptable ranges of temperature measurement should be within 96 to 99 degrees to preclude samples that are adulterated and or substituted. Witnessed collections are not necessary and in fact are not as reliable as the digital measurement of temperature within 96 to 99 degrees. (If witnessed collection is done, it should also have the digital measurement done). Plastic ""temperature strips"" which are attached to the vial should not be used to measure the temperature. Current widespread practice is for collection facilities to allow temperature certification within a range of 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, it is also common to use ""temp strips"" for the determination of the temperature. These practices do not preclude adulteration and/or substitution of the specimen and are probably the source of most of the inaccuracy and unreliability of urine drug testing today. SAMSHA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) has unwittingly encouraged these faulty practices by stating these wide limits (90 to 100 degrees) of temperature acceptability within the regulations. This has fostered nationwide incompetence in this area, allowing ""positive"" subjects to substitute or adulterate their urine unchecked and resulting in indeterminable number of ""false negative"" results. DDL's procedure for collection of specimens is available to any collection facility that desires to improve their collection procedures. Testing Procedure: Ensure all positive results are confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS analysis. This is critical to ensure no ""false positive"" results occur. There are two approaches to testing; cut-off type tests and limit of detection tests. A cut-off type test has an administrative ""limit"" set to report a positive result. If the drug is identified, but is below the limit, it is reported as ""not detected"". The LIMIT OF DETECTION - The limit of detection tests reports any detectable amount present within the capabilities of the laboratory. This is typically well below the administrative ""cut-offs"" discussed above. The most reliable ""negative"" test results are those which are determined by a ZERO TOLERANCE testing procedure. SAMSHA certified laboratories are required to adhere to established cutoff concentrations. In other words, a specified amount of the drug or drugs is allowed to be present and still be reported as ""negative"". This results again in an increased number of ""false negatives"", or the reporting of a test result as ""negative"" when the drug is actually present. To provide the most accurate and reliable information in a ""negative"" test, a ZERO TOLERANCE test should be done. Require that the laboratory follow zero tolerance by requesting that the detection limit of the drug or drugs be ruled out at the LIMIT OF DETECTION of the GC/MS procedure. If the laboratory cannot accommodate that request, find another certified laboratory that will. (SAMSHA laboratories will not perform zero tolerance testing since the regulations require that established cutoff limits be followed). Zero tolerance testing may also be more expensive, but will provide the most reliable information if testing is ""negative"" (assuming of course that the specimen was collected properly). Random Call: Random notification is an important aspect of the reliability of drug detection. The detection of any drug is subject to the timing and amount of the dose. Subjects who have used illicit drugs may allow their system to clear if they have enough time. The notification of the individual should be done so as not to allow enough time to enable the person to clear the drug. Usually a limit of 24 hours is acceptable to detected most drugs besides alcohol (ethanol). If ethanol is of concern the collection should be done within 3 to 4 hours.

D3261752	http://time.com/3399562/stop-glorifying-football-players-and-start-glorifying-soldiers/	Stop Glorifying Football Players and Start Glorifying Soldiers	IDEAS Mark Edmundson teaches at the University of Virginia and is the author of Why Football Matters: My Education in the Game. A lot of National Football League players have been right up on the front page lately, but for all the wrong reasons. Ray Rice is in serious trouble for knocking his then-fiancé out cold—the tape of the event is enough to make almost anyone at least slightly ill. Adrian Peterson will soon be up on charges for punishing his four-year-old son with a switch. Two other ballers of an especially hard-nosed type are also in trouble with the law over domestic abuse. Greg Hardy of the Carolina Panthers has been convicted of the crime: his case is on appeal. (He was on the field this past Sunday, post-conviction.) Ray Mc Donald of the San Francisco Forty-Niners is being investigated. Meanwhile, almost forgotten in the new melee of violence and possible violence, Aaron Hernandez, former star tight end of the New England Patriots, sits in a prison cell in Massachusetts awaiting trial on multiple counts of murder. What are we to make of all this? Why are these players—and perhaps a few others as yet undetected and uncharged—behaving so badly? No less a personage than Dwight David Eisenhower observed that one should never try to understand why it is that people do what they do. They simply do it, that’s all. Observe what they do and make the best of it you can. And yet one still wonders what this misbehavior is all about. When I posed the question to a friend of mine, he responded directly. What do you expect? They’ve been worshipped like gods ever since they were kids, he told me. And that’s true enough. Adults have melted in awe at their ability to fling a ball down a field, dodge a tackler, or knock another player on his can. Of course some have outsized egos and a royal sense of entitlement. Of course some think they can get away with more than the rest of us. If someone had treated you like a monarch from the time you could wear shoulder pads, so would you. If people took you for a hero because you could create first downs or stop them, what would you be like? I thought about what my friend said (and what I heaped on to his observation myself) and after a while I suspected that he was on to something. The operative word here was a common enough one. The operative word was “hero.”In our culture we treat sports players as heroes. Of course we do: because what they achieve on the playing field is amazing. Baseball players and hoop stars and of course gridiron greats perform spectacular feats all the time. And so we worship them—of course we do. But is a football player (or an ace b-baller or a twenty game winning pitcher) really a hero? If you think so, you are parting company with tradition. In the Western tradition a hero is, in the earliest manifestation, a warrior. It’s someone like Homer’s Hector, or Virgil’s Aeneas, who is willing to fight and if necessary to die to defend his people. Hector has to face the amazing Achilles in defense of Troy—and of course Hector loses. Aeneas fights all enemies, including the formidable Turnus, to secure the founding of Rome. In the Hebrew tradition, David steps up to Goliath to save his nation. Other heroic archetypes come along over time. People learn to stand in awe not only of warriors, but of saintly individuals like Jesus and Buddha and Confucius. People learn to salute great thinkers like Plato and Aristotle and later major scientists like Einstein. Human beings first find their heroes among warriors and spiritual leaders and men and women of imposing intellect. The saint, the warrior, the true thinker: these were the original heroes. We still need heroes. Everyone at every time has. But we cannot find our martial heroes on the battlefield anymore. We do not know if our recent wars are just. We do not know if our causes are true. Were we right to invade Afghanistan? Were we ultimately justified in going into Iraq? Most people are not sure. The newspapers don’t tell us many stories of the men and women who fight under our colors in the Middle East. We usually do not know who they are and what they are doing. Right now we do not have bona fide martial heroes to praise. So we worship football players instead. We worship athletes: we swoon at the feet of simulation heroes. The average NFL fan can probably name 20 football heroes. How many heroes from the war in Iraq or the war in Afghanistan can the fan name? Football players can be brave: it’s true. What they do on Saturday and Sunday afternoons is graceful, beautiful and dangerous. But no football player who ever lived or ever will live is a hero in the way that a man or woman who risks his or her life in a just cause is a hero. Those are real heroes. The Greeks were devoted to sports: they were, of course, the inventors of the Olympic games. But no Greek would tell you that an athlete was more important than Leonidas and the three hundred Spartans who stopped the Persians at Thermopylae. No Greek could imagine that an athlete was more to be praised than Themistocles and his sailors, who won the victory at Salamis. Sports heroes are simulation heroes. I love sports—don’t get me wrong. But we’ve blown the games and the players all out of proportion. The players: we treat them like Hector and Achilles and Aeneas and Ajax. We look at them as though they were man-gods. And after a decade and a half of being worshipped, is it surprising if pro athletes turn out to be willful, spoiled, bullying and selfish? Remember how the gods in the Greek myths were prone to act? They were willful and selfish and all the rest. If we could start worshipping real heroes—true thinkers and just warriors and lovers of humanity—we could take back a little bit of our investment in football idols. That would be a fine change for us all—and I’ll bet it wouldn’t be a half bad thing for the players, either. Mark Edmundson teaches at the University of Virginia.

D1163231	http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unearnedincome.asp	What is 'Unearned Income'	"What is 'Unearned Income'Unearned income is income from investments and other sources which is unrelated to employment. Examples of unearned income include interest from savings accounts, bond interest, alimony, and dividends from stock. Unearned income, known as a ""passive source of income,"" is income not acquired through work. Next Up Unearned Interest Earned Income Portfolio Entry Deferred Revenue BREAKING DOWN 'Unearned Income'Unearned income differs from earned income, which is income gained from employment, work, or through business activities. According to the IRS, earned income includes wages, salaries, tips, and self-employment income. Taxation will differ for earned income and unearned income due to qualitative differences. Additionally, tax rates vary among sources of unearned income. Most unearned income sources are not subject to payroll taxes, and none of it is subject to employment taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals with unearned income to understand the origin and taxation of their income. Types of Unearned Income Interest and dividend income are the most common types of unearned income. Interest income, such as interest earned on checking and savings deposit accounts, loans, and certificate of deposit (CD), is taxed as ordinary income. Dividends, which is income from investments, can be taxed at ordinary tax rates or preferred long-term capital gains tax rates. Investments typically yield dividends payable to shareholders on a regular basis. Dividends may be paid to the investment account monthly, quarterly, annually, or semi-annually. Each share receives a percentage of the company's profit, which is known as the dividend yield . Taxation of the total sum of the dividend yield is at the current dividend tax rate. Money earned in this capacity is unearned income, and the tax paid is considered an unearned income tax. Other sources of unearned income include: Retirement accounts (e.g., 401 (k), pension, and annuity)Inheritances Gifts Lottery Winnings Veteran's (VA) benefits Welfare benefits Property income Benefits of Unearned Income Unearned income can serve as a supplement to earned income before retirement and, often, is the only source of income in post-retirement years. During the accumulation phase, taxes are deferred for many sources of unearned income. Sources with deferment include 401 (k) plans and annuity income. As a result, participants avoid IRS penalties and paying at higher tax rates. Diversification of holdings is preferable to even-out the effect of taxes on unearned income. "

D685657	http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/8436	Clinical Information	Clinical Information Albumin is a carbohydrate-free protein, which constitutes 55% to 65% of total plasma protein. It maintains oncotic plasma pressure, is involved in the transport and storage of a wide variety of ligands, and is a source of endogenous amino acids. Albumin binds and solubilizes various compounds, including bilirubin, calcium, long-chain fatty acids, toxic heavy metal ions, and numerous pharmaceuticals. Hypoalbuminemia is caused by several factors: impaired synthesis due either to liver disease (primary) or due to diminished protein intake (secondary), increased catabolism as a result of tissue damage and inflammation, malabsorption of amino acids, and increased renal excretion (eg, nephrotic syndrome).

D1366219	http://www.moderntiredealer.com/news/400500/same-terrain-new-ko2-tire	Same terrain, new KO tire	The BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tire is the first consumer tire to incorporate the company's Core Gard technology used in racing tires to prevent sidewall splitting. The terrain is the same but the new BFGoodrich brand All-Terrain T/A KO2 tire is different from its predecessor with tougher sidewalls, longer tread life and improved traction for off-road and highway driving. Michelin North America Inc. says the All-Terrain T/A KO2 will appeal to light truck and SUV drivers who use their vehicles on the highway, on the worksite and in off-road conditions. The KO2 is an all-season tire that has earned the 3-Peak Mountain Snowflake designation from the Rubber Manufacturers Association. The company says the tire is significantly improved over its predecessor in areas its research identified as important to consumers: sidewall strength, puncture resistance, traction and durability. In comparison to the KO tire it replaces, the KO2 has:* 20% tougher sidewalls through proprietary Core Gard technology;* Two times the tread life on gravel;* 15% longer tread life on asphalt;* 10% better traction in mud; and* 19% improved snow performance. The KO2 will be available in more sizes than the KO. The company plans to offer 61 sizes in North America, versus the current 53 sizes. The KO2 is launching now in 12 sizes, with additional sizes to be launched in 2015. The sizes in the phase 1 release are: LT275/55R20 115/112s All-Terrain T/A KO2 LRD RWLLT27565R18 123/12OR TL All Terrain T/A KO2 LRE RWLT27560R20 110/116S TL All-Terrain T/A KO2 LRD RWLT265/70R18 124/121R TL All-Terrain T/A KO2 LRE RWLT285/75R16 126/123R TL All-Terrain T/A KO2 LRE RWLT285/65R20 127/124S TL All-Terrain T/A KO2 LRE RWLT265/65R18 122/119R TL All-Terrain T/A KO2 LRE RWLT285/65R18 125/122R TL All-Terrain T/A KO2 LRE RWLT245/75R16 120/116S TL All-Terrain T/A KO2 LRE RWLT315/75T16 127/124R TL All-Terrain T/A KO2 LRE RWLT265/75R16 123/120R TL All-Terrain T/A KO2 LRE RWLT235/85R16 120/116S TL All-Terrain T/A KO2 LRE RW35x12.50R18LT 123R TL All-Terrain T/A KO2 LRE RWLLT225/75R16 115/112S TL All Terrain T/A KO2 LRE RWThe KO2 is produced in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Ft. Wayne, Ind. In developing the KO2, the company says BFG engineers leveraged the latest off-road racing technology to provide consumers with an advanced tire to meet a range of conditions. KO2 borrows heavily from the BFGoodrich Baja T/A KR2 tire, which was equipped on nine of the top 10 finishers in the 2014 Tecate SCORE Baja 500. Key features of the KO2 include:* tougher sidewalls through the use of Core Gard technology developed in the Baja T/A KR2, a thicker, extended shoulder and computer modeling to predict object paths and create a sidewall design most likely to deflect protruding objects;* longer treadlife through a new tread design and rubber formulation that helps it last twice as long on gravel and 15% longer on asphalt than the previous tire, optimally blended tread rubber to reduce chips and tears on gravel, a new footprint shape and interlocking tread design to provide more uniform wear and special stone ejectors to push objects out of the tread to reduce drilling into the tire; and* aggressive traction through side biter lugs in the sidewall that improve traction in mud, snow and rocks, raised bars in the shoulder to help release compacted mud for better traction in soft soil and 3-D sipes that create biting edges for better snow traction.“The KO2 has an obvious appeal for the serious off-road enthusiast,” says Dan Newsome, US country operations manager, BFG LT tires. “It’s also expected to appeal to anyone who regularly faces challenging gravel, dirt or snow-covered roads. The KO2’s toughness, durability and traction – as well as its improved treadlife and great road manners – deliver strong benefits, whether for work, play or just to get home.”The KO2 will be released to consumers on Nov. 1, initially in 12 sizes fitting a range of vehicles, including Ford, Chevrolet, GMC, Dodge, Toyota and Nissan pickup trucks and SU’s as well as Plus Fitments for a wide variety of vehicles. The MSRP for the tire starts at $222. For more information, photos and videos about the BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tire, visit www. BFGoodrich Tires KO2.com.

(http://Owning Model S.com)Answered Jul 5, 2014 · Author has 139 answers and 237.6k answer views From my book, Owning Model S: Here’s how a typical Supercharger (in thiscase, the one at Port St Lucie, FL) is configured: the eight bay setup takes a 12 k V, 750 k VA feedfrom the Utility, steps it down to 480V three phase on site, pushes that into 2000A switchgear which feeds four banks of Supercharger units (one for each pair of “pods”) at 480V/200A. Each unit contains twelve 10 k Wrectifiers (the same “charger” that is found in Model S) giving a total of 120k W DC per pair of pods. Each pod feeds DC power at c. 400V/300A into the Model S battery via a cable plugged into the rear of the car. It is intended that Superchargers will be fed from solar power supplied from a canopy over the Supercharger station, but these are not being installed yet in an effort to simplify and accelerate the Supercharger build out.7.9k Views · View Upvoters Your response is private.

Implications of Rolling Over a 401 (k) to a Home Mortgage401 (k) retirement plans allow employees to save for retirement in a tax-deferred fashion. Typically, withdrawals from 401 (k) plans before retirement age are discouraged or prohibited except under certain ""hardship circumstances,"" such as buying a home. However, withdrawals from 401 (k) plans are penalized on the amount withdrawn, plus the withdrawal is taxed as income. Unfortunately for plan holders, tax law has no 401 (k) hardship exemptions from withdrawal penalties and taxes, meaning withdrawing from a 401 (k) can be expensive.401 (k) Withdrawals401 (k) withdrawals under hardship exemptions, such as home buying, face 10 percent penalties on such withdrawals. Additionally, if you withdraw from your 401 (k) you must pay income tax on it at tax time. All taxes on 401 (k) withdrawals are due in the year the withdrawals occurred. Lastly, withdrawing money from your 401 (k) will cost you in terms of lost earnings on the money you withdrew from that 401 (k).401 (k) Loan Financial experts advise that if you're going to use your 401 (k) to help fund your home purchase, do so through a loan instead. A 401 (k) loan, rather than a straight withdrawal, comes with certain advantages over that withdrawal. For one, the interest paid on a 401 (k) loan goes back into the account, meaning even more money eventually ends up in it. 401 (k) loan fees may apply, and if you default on it you'll owe standard penalties and taxes. Non-401 (k) Alternatives Tapping traditional IRAs or Roth IRAs rather than 401 (k)s to help fund home purchases can also make sense. For first-time home buyers, withdrawals up to $10,000 from traditional IRAs can be made without tax penalty. Home-buying withdrawals from traditional IRAs have to be spent on home purchases within 120 days of withdrawals, though. Roth IRA savers can withdraw their Roth IRA contributions at any time in any amount without penalty. This is because they have already paid taxes on their Roth contributions. Considerations Most financial experts strongly advise against out-and-out 401 (k) withdrawals because they can be so costly, penalty wise. 401 (k) loans can be for up to half a 401 (k) account's vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less, without triggering tax penalties. 401 (k) loans generally must be completely repaid within five years, though, meaning loan payments could be steep. Other alternatives to tapping retirement accounts for home purchase down payments and such include using second mortgages to fund entire home purchases.

"Bible > Topical > Leprosy Free Downloads • Devotions use heart icon >>◄ Leprosy ►Jump to: ISBE • Easton's • Webster's • Concordance • Thesaurus • Greek • Hebrew • Library • Subtopics • Terms Easton's Bible Dictionary (Hebrews tsara'ath, a ""smiting, "" a ""stroke, "" because the disease was regarded as a direct providential infliction). This name is from the Greek lepra, by which the Greek physicians designated the disease from its scaliness. We have the description of the disease, as well as the regulations connected with it, in Leviticus 13; 14; Numbers 12:10 -15, etc. There were reckoned six different circumstances under which it might develop itself, (1) without any apparent cause ( Leviticus 13:2 -8); (2) its reappearance (9-17); (3) from an inflammation (18-28); (4) on the head or chin (29-37); (5) in white polished spots (38, 39); (6) at the back or in the front of the head (40-44). Lepers were required to live outside the camp or city ( Numbers 5:1 -4; 12:10 -15, etc.). This disease was regarded as an awful punishment from the Lord ( 2 Kings 5:7; 2 Chronicles 26:20 ). (see MIRIAM; GEHAZI; UZZIAH. )This disease ""begins with specks on the eyelids and on the palms, gradually spreading over the body, bleaching the hair white wherever they appear, crusting the affected parts with white scales, and causing terrible sores and swellings. From the skin the disease eats inward to the bones, rotting the whole body piecemeal."" ""In Christ's day no leper could live in a walled town, though he might in an open village. But wherever he was he was required to have his outer garment rent as a sign of deep grief, to go bareheaded, and to cover his beard with his mantle, as if in lamentation at his own virtual death. He had further to warn passers-by to keep away from him, by calling out, `Unclean! unclean!' nor could he speak to any one, or receive or return a salutation, since in the East this involves an embrace. ""That the disease was not contagious is evident from the regulations regarding it ( Leviticus 13:12, 13, 36; 2 Kings 5:1 ). Leprosy was ""the outward and visible sign of the innermost spiritual corruption; a meet emblem in its small beginnings, its gradual spread, its internal disfigurement, its dissolution little by little of the whole body, of that which corrupts, degrades, and defiles man's inner nature, and renders him unmeet to enter the presence of a pure and holy God"" (Maclear's Handbook O. T). Our Lord cured lepers ( Matthew 8:2, 3; Mark 1:40 -42). This divine power so manifested illustrates his gracious dealings with men in curing the leprosy of the soul, the fatal taint of sin. Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary ( n.) A cutaneous disease which first appears as blebs or as reddish, shining, slightly prominent spots, with spreading edges. These are often followed by an eruption of dark or yellowish prominent nodules, frequently producing great deformity. In one variety of the disease, anaesthesia of the skin is a prominent symptom. In addition there may be wasting of the muscles, falling out of the hair and nails, and distortion of the hands and feet with destruction of the bones and joints. It is incurable, and is probably contagious. International Standard Bible Encyclopedia LEPER; LEPROSYlep'-er, lep'-ro-si (tsara`ath; lepra): A slowly progressing and intractable disease characterized by subcutaneous nodules (Hebrew se'eth; Septuagint oule; the King James Version ""rising""), scabs or cuticular crusts (Hebrew cappachath; Septuagint semasia) and white shining spots appearing to be deeper than the skin (Hebrew bahereth; Septuagint telaugema). Other signs are (1) that the hairs of the affected part turn white and (2) that later there is a growth of ""quick raw flesh."" This disease in an especial manner rendered its victims unclean; even contact with a leper defiled whoever touched him, so while the cure of other diseases is called healing, that of leprosy is called cleansing (except in the case of Miriam ( Numbers 12:13) and that of the Samaritan ( Luke 17:15) where the word ""heal"" is used in reference to leprosy). The disease is described in the Papyrus Ebers as ukhedu (the Coptic name for leprosy is tseht). It is also mentioned in ancient Indian and Japanese history. Hippocrates calls it ""the Phoenician disease,"" and Galen names it ""elephantiasis."" In Europe it was little known until imported by the returning soldiers of Pompey's army after his Syrian campaign in 61 B. C.; but after that date it is described by Soranus, Aretaeus and other classic authors. 1. Old Testament Instances: The first Old Testament mention of this disease is as a sign given by God to Moses ( Exodus 4:6 (Jahwist)), which may be the basis of the story in Josephus' Apion, I, 31, that Moses was expelled from Heliopolis on account of his being a leper (see also I, 26 and Ant, III, xi, 4). The second case is that of Miriam ( Numbers 12:10 ), where the disease is graphically described (EP2). In Deuteronomy 24:8 there is a reference to the oral tradition concerning the treatment of lepers, without any details, but in Leviticus 13; Leviticus 14 (Priestly Code) the rules for the recognition of the disease, the preliminary quarantine periods and the ceremonial methods of cleansing are given at length. It is worthy of note that neither here nor elsewhere is there any mention of treatment or remedy; and Jehoram's ejaculation implies the belief that its cure could be accomplished only by miracle ( 2 Kings 5:7 ). The case of Naaman ( 2 Kings 5:1) shows that lepers were not isolated and excluded from society among the Syrians. The leprosy of Gehazi ( 2 Kings 5:27) is said to have been the transference of that of Naaman, but, as the incubation period is long, it must have been miraculously inflicted on him. The four lepers of Samaria of 2 Kings 7:3 had been excluded from the city and were outside the gate. The leprous stroke inflicted on Uzziah ( 2 Kings 15:5 2 Chronicles 26:23) for his unwarrantable assumption of the priestly office began in his forehead, a form of the disease peculiarly unclean ( Leviticus 13:43-46) and requiring the banishment and isolation of the leper. It is remarkable that there is no reference to this disease in the prophetical writings, or in the Hagiographa. 2. Leprosy in the New Testament: In the New Testament, cleansing of the lepers is mentioned as a specific portion of our Lord's work of healing, and was included in the commission given to the apostles. There are few individual cases specially described, only the ten of Luke 17:12, and the leper whom our Lord touched ( Matthew 8:2 Mark 1:40 Luke 5:12 ), but it is probable that these are only a few out of many such incidents. Simon the leper ( Matthew 26:6 Mark 14:3) may have been one of those cured by the Lord. 3. Nature and Locality of the Disease: The disease is a zymotic affection produced by a microbe discovered by Hansen in 1871. It is contagious, although not very readily communicated by casual contact; in one form it is attended with anesthesia of the parts affected, and this, which is the commonest variety now met with in the East, is slower in its course than those forms in which nodular growths are the most prominent features, in which parts of the limbs often drop off. At present there are many lepers to be seen at the gates of the cities in Palestine. It is likewise prevalent in other eastern lands, India, China, and Japan. Cases are also to be seen in most of the Mediterranean lands and in Norway, as well as in parts of Africa and the West Indies and in South America. In former times it was occasionally met with in Britain, and in most of the older English cities there were leper houses, often called ""lazarets"" from the mistaken notion that the eczematous or varicose ulcers of Lazarus were leprous ( Luke 16:20 ). Between 1096 and 1472, 112 such leper houses were founded in England. Of this disease King Robert Bruce of Scotland died. There was special medieval legislation excluding lepers from churches and forbidding them to wander from district to district. Leprosy has been sometimes confounded with other diseases; indeed the Greek physicians used the name lepra for the scaly skin disease now called psoriasis. In the priestly legislation there was one form of disease ( Leviticus 13:13) in which the whiteness covers all the body, and in this condition the patient was pronounced to be clean. This was probably psoriasis, for leprosy does not, until a very late stage, cover all the body, and when it does so, it is not white. It has been surmised that Naaman's disease was of this kind. Freckled spots (Hebrew bohaq), which were to be distinguished from true leprosy ( Leviticus 13:39 ), were either spots of herpes or of some other non-contagious skin disease. The modern Arabic word of the same sound is the name of a form of eczema. the Revised Version (British and American) reads for freckled spot ""tetter,"" an old English word from a root implying itchiness (see Hamlet, I, v, 71). The homiletic use of leprosy as a type of sin is not Biblical. The only Scriptural reference which might approach this is Psalm 51:7, but this refers to Numbers 19:18 rather than to the cleansing of the leper. The Fathers regarded leprosy as typical of heresy rather than of moral offenses. (See Rabanus Maurus, Allegoria, under the word ""Lepra."") (1) Leprosy in Garments. The occurrence of certain greenish or reddish stains in the substance of woolen or linen fabrics or in articles made of leather is described in Leviticus 13:47 ;, and when these stains spread, or, after washing, do not change their color, they are pronounced to be due to a fretting leprosy (tsara`ath mam'ereth), and such garments are to be burnt. As among the fellahin articles of clothing are worn for years and are often hereditary, it is little wonder that they become affected by vegetable as well as animal parasites, and that which is here referred to is probably some form of mildew, such as Penicillium or mold-fungus. The destruction of such garments is a useful sanitary precaution. Possibly this sort of decaying garment was in Job's mind when he compares himself to a ""rotten thing that consumeth, like a garment that is moth-eaten"" ( Job 13:28 ); see also Jude 1:23, ""the garment spotted (espilomenon) by the flesh."" (2) Leprosy in the House ( Leviticus 14:34 ). The occurrence of ""hollow streaks, greenish or reddish,"" in the plaster of a house is regarded as evidence that the wall is affected with leprosy, and when such is observed the occupant first clears his house of furniture, for if the discoloration be pronounced leprous, all in the home would become unclean and must be destroyed. Then he asks the priest to inspect it. The test is first, that the stain is in the substance of the wall, and, second, that it is spreading. In case these conditions are fulfilled, it is pronounced to be leprosy and the affected part of the wall is taken down, its stones cast outside the city, its plaster scraped off and also cast outside the city; new stones are then built in and the house is newly plastered. Should the stain recur in the new wall, then the whole house is condemned and must be destroyed and its materials cast outside the city. The description is that of infection by some fungus attacking whatever organic material is in the mud plaster by which the wall is covered. If in woodwork, it might be the dry rot (Merulius lacrimans), but this is not likely to spread except where there is wood or other organic matter. It might be the efflorescence of mural salt (calcium nitrate), which forms fiocculent masses when decomposing nitrogenous material is in contact with lime; but that is generally white, not green or reddish. Considering the uncleanly condition of the houses of the ordinary fellah, it is little wonder that such fungus growths may develop in their walls, and in such cases destruction of the house and its materials is a sanitary necessity. 4. The Legal Attitude: It should be observed here that the attitude of the Law toward the person, garment or house suspected of leprosy is that if the disease be really present they are to be declared unclean and there is no means provided for cure, and in the case of the garment or house, they are to be destroyed. If, on the other hand, the disease be proved to be absent, this freedom from the disease has to be declared by a ceremonial purification. This is in reality not the ritual for cleansing the leper, for the Torah provides none such, but the ritual for declaring him ceremonially free from the suspicion of having the disease. This gives a peculiar and added force to the words, ""The lepers are cleansed,"" as a testimony to our Lord's Divine mission.

Alexander, USMC (Ret.) - Originally Published June 1944The Marines moving westward toward the Mariana Islands in June 1944 were about to cross the threshold into a new chapter of the violent Pacific War. ""We are through with the flat atolls now,"" warned Lieutenant General Holland M. ""Howlin' Mad"" Smith, commanding the Expeditionary Troops. ""Now we are up against mountains and caves where the Japs can really dig in. A week from now there will be a lot of dead Marines. ""The ensuing battle of Saipan, the first stage in the American conquest of the Marianas, would be the bloodiest challenge to date in the 15-month Central Pacific drive from Tarawa to two Jima. In 24 days of unrelenting assault and counterattack, the Marines, sailors and soldiers of Gen Smith's command would annihilate a force of 32,000 well-armed Japanese soldiers and rikusentai, the Special Naval Landing Forces. The Saipan invasion was a strategic gamble. The target was a thousand miles beyond the nearest American base, surrounded by enemy airfields, and well within striking distance of the still-powerful Japanese fleet. The costs in American lives and material would be staggering. But victory would bring the Japanese home islands within range of America's new B-29 bombers, rattle the imperial dynasty and shorten the endless war. American planners knew that no island this close to Japan would be cakewalk. Tiny Tarawa-a half square mile of sand and coral-had been bad enough. Saipan was 72 square miles of volcanic rock, mountains, cliffs, caves. Like Tarawa, Saipan was encircled by a fringing reef, but this time there would be no protective lagoon: The surf would be breaking directly on the reef. Additionally, in the Saipan town of Garapan, the Marines would face house-to-house fighting for the first time since Vera Cruz in 1914. Some intelligence assessments were encouraging. The Japanese long considered the Marianas as a backwater, administrative center. The sudden fury of the American amphibious offensives against the Gilberts and Marshalls caused consternation. The Imperial General Headquarters rushed reinforcements and fortification material by the shipload to Saipan and Guam. American submarines had a field day. Time and time again, these intrepid raiders interdicted Japanese manis carrying ammunition, barbed wire, concrete and steel for the islands. The biggest payoff came in the repeated sinking of troop transports. Few reinforcing elements arrived in Saipan with their unit integrity intact. As one key example, American submarines sank five of the seven transports carrying the main body of Lt Gen Yoshitsuga Saito's 43d Division from Japan to Saipan. While other ships picked up many of the survivors, the soldiers reached Saipan demoralized and largely weaponless-barely a week before the American invasion. All this submarine interdiction made a critical difference in the tactical outcome of the assault because Saipan was a defender's dream. While Gen Saito followed the same defend-at-the-water's-edge policy which had ruled at Tulagi, Gavutu, Tarawa and the Marshalls, some of his enterprising subordinates began to experiment with defense-in-depth techniques. In some cases they mounted large-caliber, direct-fire weapons in interior caves, covered the openings with steel doors, and camouflaged the entrance artfully. The Japanese figured the Americans would land on the east coast, at Magicienne Bay, and arrayed much of their firepower in that quadrant. But their artillery officers were professionals. All points on the coastline would be covered by howitzers, heavy mortars and dismounted naval guns. Holland Smith assigned the veteran Second and Fourth Marine Divisions the assault mission for Saipan. Major General Thomas E. Watson now commanded the 2d Mar Div, replacing Maj Gen Julian C. Smith. Maj Gen Harry Schmidt continued his able command of the 4th Mar Div. The Army's 27th Infantry Division under Maj Gen Ralph C. Smith comprised the reserve. Altogether, more than 70,000 Marines and soldiers would embark for the battle. The Marines were well-armed and -equipped for this campaign. Veterans of the fighting in the Solomons and Gilberts had recently assembled in Quantico, Va., to make the standard Marine division slimmer, lighter and more lethal. The most sweeping change appeared at the lowest echelon. Saipan would mark the first appearance of the Marine fire team, the four-man element of the rifle squad built around a Browning automatic rifleman. This tripled the squad's automatic firepower; more importantly, it strengthened and decentralized tactical leadership, a critical feature for the chaotic fighting to come. Each Marine division would assault Saipan with 10 times the number of portable flamethrowers, plus a battalion of Sherman medium tanks, augmented by older light tanks reconfigured with an experimental Canadian flamethrower kit made by Ronson (the Marines promptly dubbed them ""Zippo tanks""). The U. S. Fifth Fleet would again take the lead in Operation Forager. The senior leadership remained unchanged since Tarawa: Admiral Raymond A. Spruance commanded the fleet; Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner commanded the amphibious forces. Operation Forager got off to a ragged start. Mishaps in amphibious training during heavy weather off the coast of Maui killed a number of sailors and Marines. Many more died in the tragic explosion of ammunition among the LSTs staged at Pearl Harbor. The trained veterans could not be replaced, but substitute LSTs showed up in short order. This was a reflection of the gigantic outpouring from America's shipyards and ordnance plants. Where the Marines had stormed Betio Island with 125 primitive LVTs, they would cross the line of departure at Saipan with 732 amtracs, including brand-new LVT-4s, equipped with rear ramps, and LVT (A)-4s, which mounted a snub-nosed 75-mm. gun in a forward turret. The Americans would need every one of those LVTs. Saipan's fringing reef was indeed a barrier; none of the Navy's Higgins boats would be able to negotiate the combination of shallow water and high surf. Unlike Tarawa, the tide at Saipan would not be a critical factor. Neither Turner nor Holland Smith wanted to repeat the complicated choreography of Tarawa, where troops had to crawl down debark nets into Higgins boats, transfer into LVTs in rough seas, then endure a 10-mile run to the beach. For Saipan, there were enough LSTs and LVTs to do the job sensibly. The amphibious task force stopped at Eniwetok Atoll to ""shoehorn"" the assault troops into LSTs, already loaded with amtracs. The rough-riding ships steamed directly for Saipan's southwest coast. Arriving in darkness early on D-Day, the LSTs dropped anchor on line 5,500 yards offshore, opened their bow doors and launched their loaded LVTs toward the beach. The line of departure was dead ahead. As dawn broke, Navy and Marine control officers in offshore small craft were startled to see small, red flags along the reef. They had not been there the day before. The Japanese, tipped off by the preliminary UDT survey, had placed range markers offshore for their artillery spotters. Meanwhile, the American preliminary bombardment was well underway. Suspected Japanese positions were scorched by a crescendo of fire from the ships' big guns and dive bombers from the carriers. Rocket-firing LCI-Gs accompanied the LVTs and cut loose just seaward of the reef. It was-as always-an awesome sight. The Japanese maintained good fire discipline, waiting until the LVTs struck the reef line before opening fire. Naval observers, recoiling at the sudden curtain of explosions that erupted all along the line, thought the reef had been mined after all. What they were seeing was a well-orchestrated ""time-on-target"" artillery and mortar barrage performed by the largely untouched Japanese defenders. One large-caliber round made a direct hit on the forward part of an LVT carrying the assault elements of Co C, 1st Bn, 6th Marines. The force of the explosion blew several Marines to bits; Lieutenant Paul M. Dodd was severely wounded by the bones from the Marines next to him. The vehicle foundered in the surf, then drifted back out to sea. Private First Class J. T. ""Slick"" Rutherford, a Tarawa veteran, manned a .30-caliber light machine gun on the starboard side of his LVT-2 Water Buffalo on the right flank of the first wave. Rutherford found the surf at the reef's edge to be worse than the concentrated fire. The adjacent LVT nosed into a pot-hole crossing the coral; a plunging wave caught the exposed stern of the vehicle and flipped it completely over, trapping many of the Marines underneath. Rutherford's LVT made it to the beach only to be greeted by a hail of small-arms fire. Japanese marksmen shot the LVT driver in the throat. A rifle bullet ""whanged"" off the side of Rutherford's helmet. As he lurched in shock to his right, a mortar round exploded on the starboard side which flattened him and killed the troop commander beside him. The LVT crew's mission had been to proceed inland several hundred yards. Now their first job was to limp back to the ship with half the crew and troops dead and wounded. But the Americans' ship-to-shore plan for Saipan worked. The direct delivery of preloaded LVTs just seaward of the line of departure served to maximize surprise and minimize exposure to the Japanese killing zones along the reef. The Marines lost only 20 of the 719 LVTs employed to assault the beach. Once ashore, however, the story was different. The amtracs were good in the surf, but they were of limited value as infantry fighting vehicles inland. The armored LVT (A)s provided early direct fire support, but they were by no means tanks, and many were blown up by Japanese gunfire. Even the early delivery of real tanks, the Shermans, did not help the Marines break out of the beachhead that first day. The Marines were ashore in force-20,000 by nightfall-but they sustained nearly 2,000 casualties in the doing, mainly from the unrelenting artillery and mortar fire from Japanese batteries firing from reverse slope under direction of concealed observers in the high ground overlooking the beaches. Among the Marine casualties were several assault battalion commanders, including the colorful Lieutenant Colonel Henry P. ""Jim"" Crowe, commanding the 2d Bn, 8th Marines. His landing team had been forced north of Green Beach 2 by an unexpected current and the heavy enemy fire; now a dangerous gap existed between the two divisions. Crowe and his runner, Corporal William ""Dinie"" Donitaly, took off on foot to reconnoiter the gap and seek a linkup with the 23d Marines to the south. Instead, they found a squad of Japanese riflemen. Crowe, a distinguished marksman, acquitted himself well with his carbine in the ensuing firefight, but both men were cut down, badly hit. The two Marines consoled each other, Crowe trying to cover the sucking wound in his chest: ""You know, Dinie, I don't believe we're going to die."" Neither Marine did, but Crowe's ordeal was hardly over. Evacuated to the battalion aid station in ""the rear,"" Crowe was subject to intense mortar fire while being treated. Shrapnel killed the corpsman kneeling over him and wounded Crowe in five places. The American toehold was dangerous in every corner on D-Day. Both divisions landed their artillery units early to help equal the odds, but the Japanese that first day were looking right down the Marines' throats. Everyone was vulnerable. Then came the night. Marine Lt Jim Lucas, a veteran combat correspondent, described the anxiety of the initial night ashore. ""There is something definitely terrifying about the first night on a hostile beach. No matter what superiority you may boast in men and material, on that first night you're the underdog, and the enemy is in a position to make you pay through the nose."" Night counterattacks charac-terized the fighting on Saipan throughout the weeks of the battle. One of these, shortly after the landing, included the first armored counter-attack the Marines had experienced, some 40 Japanese medium attacks roaring through the darkness toward the beach. The 1st Bn, 6th Marines took the brunt of this assault, but they had a lot of help. Lt Col William K. Jones' Marines stood fast, using tanks, bazookas, direct support artillery and naval gunfire to destroy the Japanese tank battalion and slaughter the infantry. Notwithstanding these fierce counter-attacks, the Marines were ashore to stay. There was never a question of ""issue in doubt"" as at Tarawa seven months earlier. The only real threat to the capture of Saipan came from the San Bernardino and Surigao straits in the Philippines. American submarines patrolling those narrow seas sent flash reports telling Adm Spruance that the Japanese Mobile Fleet was steaming north toward the Marianas. Its mission: sink the American carriers, destroy the amphibious task force off Saipan. Spruance did not overreact. He had superior numbers and combat efficiency, particularly in his fleet air arm. But certain measures were necessary to lessen the vulnerability of the amphibs. Spruance directed Turner and Smith to offload the 27th Infantry Division immediately and prepare for curtailed support from the fleet. The amphibs would still dart in to unload critical supplies; the gunships could still return for called fire missions. But temporarily, all support ships would be dispersed. Spruance then uncoiled the striking arm of the Fifth Fleet, Rear Admiral Marc A. Mitscher's Task Force 58. The result was the epic Battle of the Philippine Sea, which included ""The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot,"" the greatest carrier battle of the war and a convincing naval victory for the United States. The Marines ashore at Saipan, typically the last to get the word, suffered a collective anxiety attack to awake one morning and find the vast supporting fleet gone. But unlike Guadalcanal, essential services continued. The amphibious ships unloaded 11,500 tons of combat cargo across the beach at the height of the naval battle. Gen Saito then knew his cause was lost. There would be no triumphant return of the Japanese fleet, no rescue or reinforcement possible for his beleaguered garrison. Still they fought on, making the Marines and soldiers pay for every dozen yards of advance. Casualty rates soared. The raging artillery fire which characterized so much of the fighting produced frightful casualties. The regimental surgeon of the 6th Marines reported treating ""nine shell fragment cases for each bullet wound. ""Fortunately, the assault forces had anticipated heavy casualties and were well-organized to handle them. Organic Navy surgeons and corpsmen deployed forward with assault units. Adm Turner provided three LSTs, configured as provisional hospital ships, in a near-shore anchorage. Four regular hospital ships, including USS Solace, entered the amphibious objective area by the third day of fighting. As usual, it was the Navy medical personnel ashore who paid the highest price for this support. A total of 414 surgeons and corpsmen were killed or wounded at Saipan, eight times the number for Tarawa. One example of this up-close medical support occurred during a counterattack against the 3d Bn, 25th Marines the night of D+4. During the height of the melee, a Japanese grenade grievously injured one Marine, and he lay bleeding badly, his right leg hanging by shreds. Two corpsmen somehow retrieved him under intense fire, but there was no safe place to treat his wounds. The battalion surgeon, Navy Lt Michael F. Keleher, decided to operate on the spot. While his corpsmen held a flashlight, Keleher coolly ignored the firing, and using only a pair of scissors, two hemostats and a tourniquet, amputated the Marine's leg, stopped the bleeding and bandaged the stump. The Marine survived. The story of the battle of Saipan is unfortunately overshadowed by the lingering ""Smith vs. Smith"" controversy. In a nutshell, Holland Smith relieved Army Gen Ralph Smith of command of the 27th Division because he perceived the junior Smith to be too passive under fire. The chief complaint concerned slow movement of the Army troops which caused the faster-moving Marine divisions on either side to suffer exposed flanks and loss of tactical momentum. Holland Smith was within his authority to take this drastic action, and he had unequivocal support from both Adm Turner and Adm Spruance. Another Army general took charge of the division, and the troops took heart and carried their load, many fighting with great distinction. But senior Army officers in rear echelons were furious. It did not matter to them that five Army division commanders were relieved of command during the war; this was the first and only occasion of a Marine Corps officer relieving an Army officer. The controversy poisoned top-level Army-Marine Corps relations for years. The real battle of Saipan raged on. The 4th Mar Div uncovered Magicienne Bay and turned north into hilly country along the eastern coast. Each piece of contested terrain earned its own nickname: Poison Ridge. Dead Man's Gulch, Back-Break Hill, Death Valley. The 1st Bn, 29th Marines seized the top of 1,554-foot Mount Tapotchau under the inspired leadership of Lt Col Rathvon Mc C. Tompkins. The mountaintop had taken a deadly toll. Earlier, a recon patrol from the 25th Marines under Sergeant Major Gilbert L. Morton had fought almost to the last man to protect their wounded until reinforcements could mount a rescue mission. Farther south, two Marine Corps observation squadrons, VMO-2 and VMO-4, landed on newly captured Aslito Airfield. The Marine aviators provided invaluable artillery spotting and reconnaissance throughout the duration of the battle. Black Marines experienced their first combat of the war. Members of the 3d Ammunition Co and the 18, 19th, and 20th Marine Depot Companies landed on D-Day to serve with the shore party. Private Kenneth J. Tibbs was killed on the beach, thus becoming the first black Marine to die in action against the enemy in the war. Two more would die at Saipan, and five others would be injured. These Marines earned the respect of their white counterparts by forming provisional rifle squads and helping repel the many Japanese counterattacks. As Time correspondent Robert Sherrod reported at the scene, ""Negro Marines, under fire for the first time, have earned a universal 4.0 on Saipan. ""Late in the battle, the surviving Japanese troops staged a massive banzai attack, some 4,000 troops screaming out of the night with swords and grenades. Finding a wide gap in the American lines, the human waves penetrated several thousand yards to overlap the artillerymen of the 14th Marines. These cannoneers died by their guns in desperate, close-range fighting. Daylight brought reinforcements and succor, but the slaughter had been great on both sides. Another horror closely followed the banzai attack. As the Marines and soldiers converged on the final enemy positions near Marpi Point in the north, hundreds of Japanese and native civilians, long brainwashed by the garrison that Americans would torture them, began killing their families and themselves by jumping off the cliffs onto the rocks below. It was one of the most heartbreaking scenes of the war. Fifty years later, the surviving natives still mention the white birds of Marpi Point. Before the mass suicides, according to legend, there had been no sea birds in evidence along the northern cliffs; now these unique birds come there every year. Victory at Saipan did not end the war, but it shortened it. America gained, in exchange for 16,000 casualties, a solid foothold in the heart of the Japanese ""Absolute Sphere of National Defense."" Ahead lay Guam and Tinian, then bloody Peleliu, two Jima and Okinawa. But Navy Seabees were already working on Saipan's airfields. Five months after the capture of Saipan, a massive fleet of B-29s would take off from U. S. air bases in the Marianas for the first direct bombing of Tokyo since the Doolittle raid of 1942. With the fall of Saipan, the Japanese could sense the inevitable. The Tojo cabinet quit in disgrace. Emperor Hirohito said, ""Hell is upon us."" he was prophetic.

At least with the s view case you can call, take notes, use camera etc. The edge panel is not so functional that I can operate my phone with the flip closed. I mean they should have at least has a quick dial panel so you could put say 10 contacts on it, then tap one and it dials with the cover closed. Just anything to make the edge panel even more functional while the cover is closed. It is kind of frustrating to be honest, that we have thw most expensive phone in samsungs lineup and the edge panel is only useful as a night clock and notification system while the flip cover is closed. I mean the s view cover on the note 4 provides a ton of functionality to its users. And in reality the s view cover is just a flip case with a cut out, and a simple software update would install the needed code for us edge users to use it. This, of course is my humble opinion.

I just picked one up at Best Buy and have been using it the last few days. It's taking me a little bit to get used to but I think I'll keep it. As you mentioned earlier, I do wish the panel was functional with the cover closed because it seems odd to have to open the cover for what seems like simple task that could be performed with the panel? It's all new though, and I'm sure someone at Samsung has noticed this oversight by now. Hopefully they will add the functionality to this phone, or it will surely be available on the E2 (Edge 2).

Also, do you have to use that neck choker thingy to carry the weight of the back piece? Please share your experience. I have owned the Circle for two weeks now and it works really well. The ear buds falling out has not been my experience. They stay in pretty good, but you do have to ensure you select the correct size for your ears. One other thing I noticed after two days of use is that I had the gels in wrong so it's important to make sure the gels are installed properly. The neck guards are actually quite comfortable to me. I forget I have them on, and I wear my Circle everyday, all day. The only negative, and it's a fairly small one, is that the headphones have no way of laying flat around my neck. The earbuds stick out when resting. It's not that big of a deal, and from a design standpoint I can't think of anyway to remedy it, but that would be the only negative. They have really made my life easier.

It’s had early sellouts, multiple volumes, and a treasury edition. But was it really profitable? In a blog post, Zubkavich lays out the realities of the economics of indie comics. You’ll need to read the whole thing for the retailer/distro split, but here’s the nut graph for creators: On a print run of 5000 comics (and many, many creator-owned titles sell less than that in the current market), it means $1250 to $2500 remains for those 4 important categories. Guess how that breaks down? If the advertising cost was ZERO and publisher expenses were ZERO, then the writer and artist of a 20 page comic would still only get $31.25 to $62.50 EACH PER PAGE. Oops, no money in there for the cover art, sorry. Add in more people (inker, colorist, letterer, etc) and the amount would get split even further, but this is a BOGUS number. The publisher has expenses/staff to pay. Now, some copies sell way more than 5000 copies, like SAGA, say, and Brian K. Vaughan is on record talking about how lucrative this comic was for him and co-creator Fiona Staples. And Robert Kirkman can probably afford a venti pumpkin latte when the urge strikes him. But for the many, many books that sell at or around this 5000 copy level. Zub’s numbers are pretty accurate. What to do? Zub writes sound practical advice: Believe it or not, I’m not bitter about all of this. It’s the price of doing business in mainstream comics via retail. That’s how it works. I just want to make it very clear so people understand what I mean when I say I’m not getting rich making my own comic. That’s why you should • Support indy titles. • Support creator-owned comics. • Pre-order books you’re interested in from your local retailer. • Tell your friends about books and help build support. • Support Kickstarter campaigns for great independent comic projects. • Buy direct from creators at conventions so 100% of the cover price goes into their pocket. Bitter or not, Zub’s numbers did draw this response from Aaron Diaz, creator of the webcomic DRESDEN CODAK: Why I’ll never ever do mainstream comics.

D2394273	http://www.oecd.org/edu/skills-beyond-school/recognitionofnon-formalandinformallearning-home.htm	Recognition of Non-formal and Informal Learning - Home	OECD Home Education Skills beyond school Recognition of Non-formal and Informal Learning - Home Recognition of Non-formal and Informal Learning - Home Now available: Recognising Non-Formal and Informal Learning: Outcomes, Policies and Practices See also Recognition of Non-formal and Informal: Learning Pointers for policy development-----------------------------------------------People are constantly learning everywhere and at all times. Not a single day goes by that does not lead to additional skills, knowledge and/or competences for all individuals. For people outside the initial education and training system, adults in particular, it is very likely that this learning, taking place at home, at the workplace or elsewhere, is a lot more important, relevant and significant than the kind of learning that occurs in formal settings. However, learning that occurs outside the formal learning system is not well understood, made visible or, probably as a consequence, appropriately valued. Until this OECD activity on the recognition of non-formal and informal learning involving 23 countries on 5 continents, it has also been under-researched (see also ongoing EU work). Most research has focused on learning outcomes from formal education and training, instead of embracing all types of learning outcomes; allowing visibility and portability of such outcomes in the lifelong learning system, in the labour market or in the community. In 1996, the OECD education ministers agreed to develop strategies for “lifelong learning for all”. The approach has been endorsed by ministers of labour, ministers of social affairs and the OECD Council at ministerial level. The concept of “from cradle to grave” includes formal, non-formal, and informal learning. It is an approach whose importance may now be clearer than ever and non-formal and informal learning outcomes are viewed as having significant value. Policy-makers in many OECD countries, and beyond, are therefore trying to develop strategies to use all the skills, knowledge and competences – wherever they come from – individuals may have at a time when countries are striving to reap the benefits of economic growth, global competitiveness and population development. Formal learning is always organised and structured, and has learning objectives. From the learner’s standpoint, it is always intentional: i.e. the learner’s explicit objective is to gain knowledge, skills and/or competences. Typical examples are learning that takes place within the initial education and training system or workplace training arranged by the employer. One can also speak about formal education and/or training or, more accurately speaking, education and/or training in a formal setting. This definition is rather consensual. Informal learning is never organised, has no set objective in terms of learning outcomes and is never intentional from the learner’s standpoint. Often it is referred to as learning by experience or just as experience. The idea is that the simple fact of existing constantly exposes the individual to learning situations, at work, at home or during leisure time for instance. This definition, with a few exceptions (see Werquin, 2007) also meets with a fair degree of consensus. Mid-way between the first two, non-formal learning is the concept on which there is the least consensus, which is not to say that there is consensus on the other two, simply that the wide variety of approaches in this case makes consensus even more difficult. Nevertheless, for the majority of authors, it seems clear that non-formal learning is rather organised and can have learning objectives. The advantage of the intermediate concept lies in the fact that such learning may occur at the initiative of the individual but also happens as a by-product of more organised activities, whether or not the activities themselves have learning objectives. In some countries, the entire sector of adult learning falls under non-formal learning; in others, most adult learning is formal. Non-formal learning therefore gives some flexibility between formal and informal learning, which must be strictly defined to be operational, by being mutually exclusive, and avoid overlap. Because non-formal and informal learning is happening everywhere all the time, this OECD activity could not address all the issues related to non-formal and informal learning in general. In consultation with the participating countries, it was agreed to focus solely on the processes that make visible this learning that has not been formal. Therefore, this OECD activity focuses on the process of formal recognition of non-formal and informal learning. Whether through the awarding of a full certification, a partial certification, a right of access to the higher education system or to any programme in the formal lifelong learning system or any recognised document (portfolio of competences, competence passport…): this activity makes the case that individuals engaging in a recognition process for their non-formal and informal learning outcomes must be awarded a document that has social value and is widely recognised so that they can benefit from it, now or later in life, when returning to the formal lifelong learning system or to the labour market. The assumption behind the work reported here is that all learning has value and most of it deserves to be made visible and recognised. It is a clear possible option, and a plausible alternative to formal education and training, to have non-formal and informal learning assessed. The real question is under which condition (s) the learning that has not been recognised can be codified, and lead to the awarding of a document. There are issues of cost and motivation of individuals that are somewhat difficult to address. Nevertheless, many countries are putting recognition of non-formal and informal learning at the top of their policy agenda and the time has come for a thorough evaluation of what it entails. This is what this OECD activity attempts to do, in collaboration with the 23 countries, using the existing literature, the scarce data in the field and fact-finding study implicit in the thematic review visits carried out in 16 countries. The recognition of non-formal and informal learning is an important means for making the ‘lifelong learning for all’ agenda a reality for all and, subsequently, for reshaping learning to better match the needs of the 21st century knowledge economies and open societies.------------------------------------------------------------------------Recognition of Non-Formal and Informal Learning: Country Practices Reconnaissance des acquis d'apprentissages non formels et informels : Les pratiques des pays Issues for analysis Methodology Objectives Contextual factors Conferences and meetings List of participating countries with related documents and publications Relevant documents Useful links Contacts Related Documents Recognising Non-formal and Informal Learning Pointers for policy development 
D1464727	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/10/exclusive-energy-for-trump-explosive-in-las-vegas-at-freedom-fest/	Exclusive â Energy For Trump Explosive In Las Vegas At Freedom Fest	Exclusive — Energy For Trump Explosive In Las Vegas At Freedom Fest Getty Imagesby Matthew Boyle 10 Jul 2015 Las Vegas 159LAS VEGAS, Nevada — He’s got a golden building with a five-star hotel right off Las Vegas Boulevard with his last name emblazoned across its top—but no casino inside since his fellow billionaire casino mogul Steve Wynn has for years blocked his access to a gambling license here—and 2016 GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump is stealing the show here at the annual Freedom Fest conference.“I think that for years we’ve been clamoring for politicians to tell us the truth, and what happened is he said some things that can very well be unpopular and perhaps it was a bit brash but ultimately he was trying to tackle the issue of illegal immigration and the danger that an open border poses—it’s some very real stuff—but now there’s this odd public backlash,” Greg Campbell from Politistick, a new media blog site, said in an interview on the Mezzanine level of the Planet Hollywood Casino and Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Campbell, who personally adores Trump and has for years, told Breitbart News that most of his wardrobe is filled Trump merchandise: Ties, shirts, cuff links and more. In fact, the cuff links he was wearing here on Thursday when he sat down with Breitbart News were Trump cuff links.“No matter how you feel about Donald Trump as a businessman or as a political candidate, one thing is simply undeniable: His corporation makes fantastic clothes,” Campbell said. “Half my professional wardrobe is Donald Trump attire.”advertisement“I’m even wearing Donald Trump cuff links as we speak,” Campbell added, holding up his wrist to show off the silvery Trump gear on his arm. Richard Miniter, the CEO of the American Media Institute—an organization that helps push investigative journalism into mainstream media outlets—told Breitbart News in an interview here that Trump is resonating nationwide because he’s so “unpredictable and entertaining.”“Donald Trump is always fun to watch because you never know what he is going to say next,” Miniter said. In fact, I don’t even think he knows what he is going to say next. Donald Trump is unpredictable and entertaining. Ultimately, I don’t think he is going to become the nominee of any major political party because we’ve kind of decided over the last 70-80 years in American politics that we want our major party candidates to be disciplined and focused and say the same thing to different groups of voters, not make it up as you go along. The presidency is not something you can wing. On the other hand, he’s raising a lot of issues other candidates are afraid to touch such as immigration, such as trade with China, and that does resonate with people especially the white working class which was the mainstay of the Democratic Party for many years but now seems to be in play. Those are your Reagan Democrats and the [5 million who stayed home when Mitt Romney was the GOP nominee], 7 million by some counts.“People love a fighter,” Miniter added. “He’s clear in what he has to say and he’s clear and he’s engaging. And he doesn’t seem to have a lot of jargon. All of those things are attractive and interesting. Heck, I like to watch Trump. But I like bull fights and demolition derbies too.”Wayne Allyn Root, businessman and 2008 Libertarian Party Vice Presidential candidate who’s out with a new book “The Power of Relentless,” told Breitbart News he’s massively impressed with Trump on the campaign trail. Root is involved in Nevada Republican politics, so his effusive praise for Trump may go a long way in this early state.“Look at Donald Trump: If you tell the truth, Democrats destroy your life,” Root said in an interview with Breitbart News here. He’s out at NBC. He’s out at Univision. He’s out at Serta Mattresses. He’s out of the PGA. He’s out at Macy’s. Why aren’t conservatives out boycotting Macy’s? Why aren’t we boycotting San Francisco, a sanctuary city? We’ve got to do something that hurts them, that takes their money away that disturbs them, that punishes them, because elections no longer seem to matter. There has got to be consequences. Asked about the new Economist/You Gov poll that has Trump in first place nationally, Root said the poll proves that the Republican nominee in 2016 will either be Trump or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.“That’s the two that really have the best shot or will win the nomination for the GOP,” Root said. “The establishment, they may well be Democrats at this point. That’s the disdain I have for the establishment of the Republican Party yet I’m still a proud Republican. I just think our party has been hijacked by idiots and people who believe in the agenda of corporate America rather than the agenda of the middle class.”Matt Nye of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a group that supports political outsiders like Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rand Paul (R-KY), told Breitbart News that Trump is resonating for a reason.“I disagree with him on a lot of policy positions but I think the reason he’s so popular is because he actually speaks his mind,” Nye said in an interview here. He will not back down. I believe for the most part, he believes what he says—and he’s paying a price for it with some of these businesses’ actions—and I think the American people are just so starved for leadership and somebody who will stand up that even though we may not agree with 50 percent or even 70 percent of what he says, just the fact that somebody is willing to stand up and not back down on these issues is so refreshing.

D2072127	http://www.gumboradio.com/	Gumbo Radio, signing off	Gumbo Radio, signing off Posted by Reese on Jan 24, 2016 in stuff | 6 comments As I mentioned a few days back (“ Internet radio under fire “), there’s a train that’s been coming down the track for some time. For the internet radio broadcasting network Live365, it’s scheduled to pull into the station by the end of the month. For Gumbo Radio, it also means we will cease our broadcast next weekend on January 31, 2016. In an email to its broadcasters on January 15, Live365 stated: We are sad that we are closing our doors at the end of this month. There are always possibilities that we can come back in one form or another, but at this point in time, January 31, 2016 is the last day that Live365’s streaming servers and website will be maintained and supported. This is a surprise to us as it is to all of you. We are proud that Live365 was a pioneer in the streaming music business and have provided a platform to hundreds of thousands of broadcasters to have a voice over the years. Unfortunately, we have to say good bye. …We are honored to have served your needs over the last decade and a half. It has been a wild ride both economically, from the pre-dotcom bust days all the way through the Great Recession, as well as technologically, with internet radio going from an unknown, quirky, muddy idea to a ubiquitous technology that hundreds of millions enjoy. Sadly, Live365’s portion of the ride is ending. Again, streaming services and website access will not be supported beyond 1/31/2016. We have extremely limited resources with the current skeleton crew. We regret that we will not be able to respond to all of you, so we apologize in advance. All the best,The Live365 Team Until Live365 pulls the plug, Gumbo Radio will keep rolling. After January 31, this website will remain up, as will the Facebook page. If I figure out a solution to all this, I’ll post information through these two avenues. I started this little project with Live365 in December 2008. It was a few years after my brother Shamus and I, along with our father, had created one of the first internet radio stations – Louisiana Radio.com. After that venture, I couldn’t shake the broadcast bug, so I started Gumbo Radio. The great thing about Live365’s operation was that they were paying BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC for the small shops like Gumbo Radio to broadcast. Under the new regulations, which I think are needed to pay musicians what they justly deserve for their work, the larger outfits like Spotify and Pandora will have to pay more for music. Live365 contends that the new costs are driving it out of business. Since I learned within the last month that Live365 was shutting down, I’ve been looking at other options. As best I can surmise, in order to continue broadcasting the 24-hour, live stereo music stream, I’m looking at costs that are at least ten times what I’ve been paying to broadcast Gumbo Radio over Live365. Raising and ensuring a steady revenue stream to run this operation would then turn this into a job—and work. That’s never what this has been about, and I’m not looking to start now. I’ve never made a dime on Gumbo Radio. It’s always been a money-losing proposition, but I’ve been cool with that. It was my hobby. My golf. I let my kids record voiceovers for the station and let them chime in on which songs needed to be added to and removed from the mix. In the seven years we’ve been broadcasting, we’ve amassed a catalog of 18,545 songs for a playlist that’s over 44.7 days long. The primary focus has always been on the music of Louisiana, but I’ve thrown other artists into the mix like James Brown, Bob Wills, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Mississippi Sheiks, Randy Newman, Otis Redding, Big Star, Johnny “Guitar” Watson, Flat Duo Jets, R. L. Burnside, Mose Allison, Junior Kimbrough, and ZZ Top. In October 2012, I initiated an Indiegogo campaign ( Gumbo Radio: phase deux) to upgrade some gear, and we surpassed our goal by 53 percent with the help of our faithful listeners. The current situation puts me in a funk—not the good kind where The Meters are playing. Gumbo Radio has been a place where I’ve been able to scratch multiple itches—music, broadcasting, and computers. I’m not looking for this part of my life to end. I’ve met some wonderful people, both in person and online, who share a common love of music. For that, I’m thankful. That’s been the greatest part of all this—that music has done what it’s supposed to do. It’s brought people together. I’m also frustrated. It’s like my seven-year-old daughter said the other day after I explained the situation to her, “There just seems like there’s something we can do.” I tried to explain to her that sometimes the costs outweigh the benefits, and you just have to move on. I tried to also remind her—as I’ve been trying to tell myself—that maybe there’s a reason for all of this. Maybe there’s something else at work here that we’re just not seeing clearly right now. I can’t help but recall what Joe Burge (aka Dr. Feelgood) told me back in 2002 when he talked about Swamp ‘n’ Roll, “It’s been a groove. . . . We’ve been doing what we want to do. We haven’t made a king’s fortune at it, but we’ve made people happy. If at all stopped today, we could look back on it and say, ‘Yeah, it was worth it. '”Amen, brother. Read More

D1377659	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control	Gun control	"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedianavigation search For international arms restrictions, see arms control. For techniques for the safe handling, possession, and storage of firearms, see gun safety. For the debate about gun control in the U. S., see Gun politics in the United States. Gun control (or firearms regulation) [1] [2] is the set of laws or policies that regulate the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification, or use of firearms by civilians. Most countries have a restrictive firearm guiding policy, with only a few legislations being categorized as permissive. [3] Jurisdictions that regulate access to firearms typically restrict access to only certain categories of firearms and then to restrict the categories of persons who will be granted a firearms license to have access to a firearm. In some countries such as the United States, gun control may be legislated at either a federal level or a local state level. Contents [ hide ]1 Terminology and context2 Regulation of civilian firearms2.1 International and regional civilian firearm regulation3 Studies3.1 General3.2 United States3.2.1 Cross-sectional studies3.2.2 Reviews3.2.3 Studies of individual laws3.2.4 Other studies and debate3.3 Canada3.4 Australia3.5 Other countries4 See also4.1 International4.2 United States5 Notes6 References7 Bibliography8 External links Terminology and context See also: Small arms trade and Small arms and light weapons Gun control refers to domestic regulation of firearm manufacture, trade, possession, use, and transport, specifically with regard to the class of weapons referred to as small arms ( revolvers and self-loading pistols, rifles and carbines, assault rifles, submachine guns and light machine guns ). [4] [5]Usage of the term gun control is sometimes politicized. [6] Some of those in favor of legislation instead prefer to use terms such as ""gun-violence prevention"", ""gun safety"", ""firearms regulation"", ""illegal guns"", or ""criminal access to guns"". [7]In 2007, it was estimated that there were, globally, about 875 million small arms in the hands of civilians, law enforcement agencies, and armed forces. [a] [8] Of these firearms 650 million, or 75%, are held by civilians. [8] U. S. civilians account for 270 million of this total. [8] A further 200 million are controlled by state military forces. [9] Law enforcement agencies have some 26 million small arms. [9] Non-state armed groups [b] have about 1.4 million firearms. [c] [9] Finally, gang members hold between 2 and 10 million small arms. [9] Together, the small arms arsenals of non-state armed groups and gangs account for, at most, 1.4% of the global total. [10]Regulation of civilian firearms Barring a few exceptions, [d] most countries in the world allow civilians to purchase firearms subject to certain restrictions. [13] A 2011 survey of 28 countries over five continents [e] found that a major distinction between different national regimes of firearm regulation is whether civilian gun ownership is seen as a right or a privilege. [16] The study concluded that both the United States and Yemen were distinct from the other countries surveyed in viewing firearm ownership as a basic right of civilians and in having more permissive regimes of civilian gun ownership. [16] In the remaining countries included in the sample, civilian firearm ownership is considered a privilege and the legislation governing possession of firearms is correspondingly more restrictive. [16]International and regional civilian firearm regulation At the international and regional level, diplomatic attention has tended to focus on the cross-border illegal trade in small arms as an area of particular concern rather than the regulation of civilian-held firearms. [17] During the mid-1990s, however, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) adopted a series of resolutions relating to the civilian ownership of small arms. [17] These called for an exchange of data on national systems of firearm regulation and for the initiation of an international study of the issue. [17] In July 1997, ECOSOC issued a resolution that underlined the responsibility of UN member states to competently regulate civilian ownership of small arms and which urged them to ensure that their regulatory frameworks encompassed the following aspects: firearm safety and storage; penalties for the unlawful possession and misuse of firearms; a licensing system to prevent undesirable persons from owning firearms; exemption from criminal liability to promote the surrender by citizens of illegal, unsafe or unwanted guns; and, a record-keeping system to track civilian firearms. [17] In 1997, the UN published a study based on member state survey data titled the United Nations International Study on Firearm Regulation which was updated in 1999. [f] [17] This study was meant to initiate the establishment of a database on civilian firearm regulations which would be run by the Centre for International Crime Prevention, located in Vienna. who were to report on national systems of civilian firearm regulation every two years. [17] These plans never reached fruition and further UN-led efforts to establish international norms for the regulation of civilian-held firearms were stymied. [18] Responding to pressure from the U. S. government, [g] [20] any mention of the regulation of civilian ownership of small arms was removed from the draft proposals for the 2001 UN Programme of Action on Small Arms. [17]Although the issue is no longer part of the UN policy debate, since 1991 there have been eight regional agreements involving 110 countries concerning aspects of civilian firearm possession. [17] The Bamako Declaration, [h] was adopted in Bamako, Mali, on 1 December 2000 by the representatives of the member states of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). [21] The provisions of this declaration recommend that the signatories would establish the illegal possession of small arms and light weapons as a criminal offence under national law in their respective countries. [22]Studies High rates of gun mortality and injury are often cited as a primary impetus for gun control policies. [23] A 2004 National Research Council critical review found that while some strong conclusions are warranted from current research, the state of our knowledge is generally poor. [24] The result of the scarcity of relevant data is that gun control is one of the most fraught topics in American politics [25] and scholars remain deadlocked on a variety of issues. [25] Notably, since 1996, when the Dickey Amendment was first inserted into the federal spending bill, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been prohibited from using its federal funding ""to advocate or promote gun control,"" thwarting gun violence research at the agency at the time. The funding provision's author has said that this was an over-interpretation, [26] but the amendment still had a chilling effect, effectively halting federally funded firearm-related research. [27] Since the amendment, the CDC has continued to research gun violence and publish studies about it, [28] although their funding for such research has fallen by 96% since 1996, according to Mayors Against Illegal Guns. [29] According to a spokesman, the CDC has limited funding and hasn't produced any comprehensive study aimed at reducing gun violence since 2001. [30]General A 1998 review found that suicide rates generally declined after gun control laws were enacted, and concluded that ""The findings support gun control measures as a strategy for reducing suicide rates."" [31] A 2016 review found that laws banning people under restraining orders due to domestic violence convictions from accessing guns were associated with ""reductions in intimate partner homicide"". [32] Another 2016 review identified 130 studies regarding restrictive gun laws and found that the implementation of multiple such laws simultaneously was associated with a decrease in gun-related deaths. [33]According to a 2011 UN study, after identifying a number of methodological problems, it stated ""notwithstanding such challenges, a significant body of literature tends to suggest that firearm availability predominantly represents a risk factor rather than a protective factor for homicide. In particular, a number of quantitative studies tend towards demonstrating a firearm prevalence-homicide association."" [34]United States Main articles: Gun law in the United States, Gun politics in the United States, Gun culture in the United States, and Gun violence in the United States Cross-sectional studies In 1983, a cross-sectional study of all 50 U. S. states found that the six states with the strictest gun laws (according to the National Rifle Association) had suicide rates that were approximately 3/100,000 people lower than in other states, and that these states' suicide rates were 4/100,000 people lower than those of states with the least restrictive gun laws. [35] A 2003 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine looked at the restrictiveness of gun laws and suicide rates in men and women in all 50 U. S. states and found that states whose gun laws were more restrictive had lower suicide rates among both sexes. [36] In 2004, another study found that the effect of state gun laws on gun-related homicides was ""limited"". [37] A 2005 study looked at all 50 states in the U. S. and the District of Columbia, and found that no gun laws were associated with reductions in firearm homicide or suicide, but that a "" shall-issue "" concealed carry law may be associated with increased firearm homicide rates. [38] A 2011 study found that firearm regulation laws in the United States have ""a significant deterrent effect on male suicide"". [39] A 2013 study found that in the United States, ""A higher number of firearm laws in a state are associated with a lower rate of firearm fatalities in the state."" [40] A 2016 study published in The Lancet found that of 25 laws studied, and in the time period examined (2008–2010), nine were associated with reduced firearm mortality (including both homicide and suicide), nine were associated with increased mortality, and seven had an inconclusive association. The three laws most strongly associated with reduced firearm mortality were laws requiring universal background checks, background checks for ammunition sales, and identification for guns. [41] In an accompanying commentary, David Hemenway noted that this study had multiple limitations, such as not controlling for all factors that may influence gun-related deaths aside from gun control laws, and the use of 29 explanatory variables in the analysis. [42]Other studies comparing gun control laws in different U. S. states include a 2015 study which found that in the United States, ""stricter state firearm legislation is associated with lower discharge rates"" for nonfatal gun injuries. [43] A 2014 study that also looked at the United States found that children living in states with stricter gun laws were safer. [44] Another study looking specifically at suicide rates in the United States found that the four handgun laws examined (waiting periods, universal background checks, gun locks, and open carrying regulations) were associated with ""significantly lower firearm suicide rates and the proportion of suicides resulting from firearms."" The study also found that all four of these laws (except the waiting-period one) were associated with reductions in the overall suicide rate. [45] Another study, published the same year, found that states with permit to purchase, registration, and/or license laws for handguns had lower overall suicide rates, as well as lower firearm suicide rates. [46] A 2014 study found that states that required licensing and inspections of gun dealers tended to have lower rates of gun homicides. [47] Another study published the same year, analyzing panel data from all 50 states, found that stricter gun laws may modestly reduce gun deaths. [48] A 2016 study found that U. S. military veterans tend to commit suicide with guns more often than the general population, thereby possibly increasing state suicide rates, and that ""the tendency for veterans to live in states without handgun legislation may exacerbate this phenomenon."" [49] California has exceptionally strict gun sales laws, and a 2015 study found that it also had the oldest guns recovered in crimes of any states in the U. S.. The same study concluded that ""These findings suggest that more restrictive gun sales laws and gun dealer regulations do make it more difficult for criminals to acquire new guns first purchased at retail outlets."" [50] Another 2016 study found that stricter state gun laws in the United States reduced suicide rates. [51] Another 2016 study found that U. S. states with lenient gun control laws had more gun-related child injury hospital admissions than did states with stricter gun control laws. [52] A 2017 study found that suicide rates declined more in states with universal background check and mandatory waiting period laws than in states without these laws. [53] Another 2017 study found that states without universal background check and/or waiting period laws had steeper increases in their suicide rates than did states with these laws. [54] A third 2017 study found that ""waiting period laws that delay the purchase of firearms by a few days reduce gun homicides by roughly 17%."" [55] A 2017 study in the Economic Journal found that mandatory handgun purchase delays reduced ""firearm related suicides by between 2 to 5 percent with no statistically significant increase in non-firearm suicides,"" and were ""not associated with statistically significant changes in homicide rates."" [56]Reviews A review of published studies of gun control released in October 2003 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was unable to determine any statistically significant effect resulting from such laws, although the authors suggest that further study may provide more conclusive information, and noted that ""insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness"". [57]: 18In 2015, Garen Wintemute and Daniel Webster reviewed studies examining the effectiveness of gun laws aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of high-risk individuals in the United States. They found that some laws prohibiting gun possession by people under domestic violence restraining orders or who had been convicted of violent misdemeanors were associated with lower violence rates, as were laws establishing more procedures to see if people were prohibited from owning a gun under these laws. They also found that multiple other gun regulations intended to prevent prohibited individuals from obtaining guns, such as ""rigorous permit-to-purchase"" laws and ""comprehensive background checks"", were ""negatively associated with the diversion of guns to criminals."" [58]A 2016 systematic review found that restrictive gun licensing laws were associated with lower gun injury rates, while concealed carry laws were not significantly associated with rates of such injuries. [59] Another systematic review found that stricter gun laws were associated with lower gun homicide rates; this association was especially strong for background check and permit-to-purchase laws. [60]Studies of individual laws Other studies have examined trends in firearm-related deaths before and after gun control laws are either enacted or repealed. A 2004 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found evidence that child access prevention laws were ""associated with a modest reduction in suicide rates among youth aged 14 to 17 years."" [61] Two 2015 studies found that the permit-to-purchase law passed in Connecticut in 1995 was associated with a reduction in firearm suicides and homicides. [62] [63] One of these studies also found that the repeal of Missouri's permit-to-purchase law was associated with ""a 16.1% increase in firearm suicide rates,"" [62] and a 2014 study by the same research team found that the repeal of this law was associated with a 16% increase in homicide rates. [64] A 2000 study designed to assess the effectiveness of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act found that the law was not associated with reductions in overall homicide or suicide rates, but that it was associated with a reduction in the firearm suicide rate among individuals aged 55 or older. [65] A 1991 study looked at Washington, D. C. 's Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, which banned its residents from owning all guns except certain shotguns and sporting rifles, which were also required to be unloaded, disassembled, or stored with a trigger lock in their owners' homes. [66] The study found that the law's enactment was associated with ""a prompt decline in homicides and suicides by firearms in the District of Columbia."" [67] A 1996 study reanalyzed this data and reached a significantly different conclusion as to the effectiveness of this law. [68]Other studies and debate Kleck and Patterson analyzed the impact of 18 major types of gun control laws on every major type of violent crime or violence (including suicide) in 170 U. S. cities, and found that gun laws generally had no significant effect on violent crime rates or suicide rates. [69] [ needs update] Similarly, a 1997 study found that gun control laws had only a small influence on the rate of gun deaths in U. S. states compared to socioeconomic variables. [70] [ needs update]Philosophy professor Michael Huemer argues that gun control may be morally wrong, even if its outcomes would be positive, because individuals have a prima facie right to own a gun for self-defence and recreation. [71]Canada Main article: Gun laws in Canada Rifles and shotguns are relatively easy to obtain, while handguns and some semi-automatic rifles are restricted. [72]With respect to the Criminal Law Amendment Act, a gun control law passed in Canada in 1977, some studies have found that it was ineffective at reducing homicide or robbery rates. [73] [74] One study even found that the law may have actually increased robberies involving firearms. [74] A 1993 study found that after this law was passed, gun suicides decreased significantly, as did the proportion of suicides committed in the country with guns. [75] A 2003 study found that this law ""may have had an impact on suicide rates, even after controls for social variables,"" [76] while a 2001 study by the same research team concluded that the law ""may have had an impact on homicide rates, at least for older victims."" [77] A 1994 study found that after this law came into force in 1978, suicide rates decreased over time in Ontario, and that there was no evidence of method substitution. The same study found that ""These decreases may be only partly due to the legislation."" [78]In 1991, Canada implemented the gun control law Bill C-17. According to a 2004 study, after this law was passed, firearm-related suicides and homicides, as well as the percentage of suicides involving firearms, declined significantly in that country. [79] A 2010 study found that after this law was passed, firearm suicides declined in Quebec among men, but acknowledged that this may not represent a causal relationship. [80] In 1992, Canada promulgated the Canadian Firearms Act, which aimed at ensuring that guns were stored safely. A 2004 study found that although firearm suicide rates declined in the Quebec region Abitibi-Témiscamingue after the law was passed, overall suicide rates did not. [81] A 2008 study reached similar conclusions with regard to the entire Quebec province; this study also found that C-17 did not seem to increase the rate at which the firearm suicide rate was declining. [82] Other researchers have criticized this 2008 study for looking at too short a time period and not taking account of the fact that the regulations in C-17 were implemented gradually. [80]A 1990 study compared suicide rates in the Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada metropolitan area (where gun control laws were more restrictive) with those in the Seattle, Washington area in the United States. The overall suicide rate was essentially the same in the two locations, but the suicide rate among 15 to 24 year olds was about 40 percent higher in Seattle than in Vancouver. The authors concluded that ""restricting access to handguns might be expected to reduce the suicide rate in persons 15 to 24 years old, but...it probably would not reduce the overall suicide rate."" [83]A 2012 study looked at gun control laws passed in Canada from 1974 to 2008 and found no evidence that these laws had a beneficial effect on firearm homicide rates in that country. According to the study, ""other factors found to be associated with homicide rates were median age, unemployment, immigration rates, percentage of population in low-income bracket, Gini index of income equality, population per police officer, and incarceration rate."" [84]A 2013 study of the 1995 Canadian gun control law Firearms Act, 1995 reported little evidence that this law significantly reduced rates of lethal gun violence against women. [85]Australia Main article: Gun laws in Australia In 1988 and 1996, gun control laws were enacted in the Australian state of Victoria, both times following mass shootings. A 2004 study found that in the context of these laws, overall firearm-related deaths, especially suicides, declined dramatically. [86] A 1995 study found preliminary evidence that gun control legislation enacted in Queensland, Australia reduced suicide rates there. [87]A 2006 study by gun lobby-affiliated researchers Jeanine Baker and Samara Mc Phedran found that after Australia enacted the National Firearms Agreement (NFA), a gun control law, in 1996, gun-related suicides may have been affected, but no other parameter appeared to have been. [88] Another 2006 study, led by Simon Chapman, found that after this law was enacted in 1996 in Australia, the country went more than a decade without any mass shootings, and gun-related deaths (especially suicides) declined dramatically. [89] The latter of these studies also criticized the former for using a time-series analysis despite the fact that, according to Chapman et al., ""calculating mortality rates and then treating them as a number in a time series ignores the natural variability inherent in the counts that make up the numerator of the rate."" Chapman et al. also said that Baker and Mc Phedran used the Box–Jenkins model inappropriately. [89] A 2010 study looking at the effect of the NFA on gun-related deaths found that the law ""did not have any large effects on reducing firearm homicide or suicide rates,"" [90] although David Hemenway has criticized this study for using a structural break test despite the fact that such tests can miss the effects of policies in the presence of lags, or when the effect occurs over several years. [91] Another study, published the same year, found that Australia's gun buyback program reduced gun-related suicide rates by almost 80%, while non-gun death rates were not significantly affected. [92] Other research has argued that although gun suicide rates fell after the NFA was enacted, the NFA may not have been responsible for this decrease and ""a change in social and cultural attitudes"" may have instead been at least partly responsible. [93] In 2016, Chapman co-authored another study that found that after the NFA was passed, there were no mass shootings in the country (as of May 2016), and that gun-related death rates declined more quickly after the NFA than they did before it. The study also found, however, that non-gun suicide and homicide rates declined even more quickly after the NFA, leading the authors to conclude that ""it is not possible to determine whether the change in firearm deaths can be attributed to the gun law reforms."" [94]Other countries Further information: Overview of gun laws by nation A 2007 study found evidence that gun control laws passed in Austria in 1997 reduced the rates of firearm suicide and homicide in that country. [95] In Brazil, after disarmament laws were passed in 2003, [96] gun-related mortality declined by 8% in 2004 relative to the previous year, the first decline observed in a decade. Gun-related hospitalizations also reversed their previous trend by decreasing 4.6% from 2003 to 2004. [97] A 2006 study found that after gun control laws were passed in New Zealand in 1992, suicides committed with guns declined significantly, especially among youth. The same study found a decline in overall youth suicide after the laws were passed, but also concluded that ""it is not possible to determine the extent to which this was accounted for by changes in firearms legislation or other causes."" [98] A 2010 study looked at the effect of a policy adopted by the Israeli Defense Forces that restricted access to guns among adolescents on suicide rates, and found that ""Following the policy change, suicide rates decreased significantly by 40%."" The authors concluded that ""The results of this study illustrate the ability of a relatively simple change in policy to have a major impact on suicide rates."" [99] A 2013 study showed that after the Military of Switzerland adopted the Army XXI reform, which restricted gun availability, in 2003, suicide rates—both overall and firearm-related—decreased. [100] Another 2013 study looking at four restrictive gun laws passed in Norway found that two of them may have reduced firearm mortality among men, but that the evidence was more inconclusive with respect to all of the laws they studied. [101] A 2014 study found that after South Africa 's Firearm Control Act was passed in 2000, homicide rates in the country declined, and concluded that ""stricter gun control mediated by the FCA accounted for a significant decrease in homicide overall, and firearm homicide in particular, during the study period [2001–2005]."" [102] A 2000 study found that a ban on carrying guns in Colombia was associated with reductions in homicide rates in two cities in the country, namely, Cali and Bogotá.

[8]^ Composed of 'insurgents and militias, including dormant and state-related groups'. [10]^ However, as of 2009, active non-state armed groups, numbering about 285,000 combatants, control only about 350,000 small arms. [11]^ Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, and Taiwan (Republic of China) prohibit civilian ownership of firearms in almost all instances. Eritrea and Somalia also prohibit civilian possession of firearms as part of their implementation of the UN Programme of Action on Small Arms. In the Solomon Islands civilian firearm ownership is restricted to members of the Regional Assistance Mission. [12]^ The survey, carried out by the Small Arms Survey included 28 countries (42 jurisdictions in total). The countries included in the sample were: Africa: Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda;Americas: Belize, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Dominican Republic, United States, Venezuela;Asia: India, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Singapore, Turkey, Yemen;Europe: Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Russian Federation, Switzerland, United Kingdom;Oceania: Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea. [14]The study states that 'while the sample is diverse and balanced, it may not be representative of the systems in place in countries outside the sample'. [15]^ The impetus behind this study was twofold: firstly, there were concerns over the incidence of firearm-related crimes, accidents and suicides; secondly, there was the apprehension that existing regulatory instruments administering the ownership, storage and training in the use of firearms held by civilians might be inadequate. [17]^ The US government was opposed to a section of the draft proposal calling on countries 'to seriously consider the prohibition of unrestricted trade and private ownership of small arms and light weapons'.

How did you compute the value of the work that may be ordered during the extension since the government is not obligated to buy anything during that extension? That's a good question. Currently, we have requirements in house; however, if we didn't have specific requirements already in house, I would ask the PM to provide a projection of possible orders during the extension time frame. Additionally, the extension was put in place to cover any requirements that may arise before a new requirements contract is put into place.

Vern Edwards Platinum Member Members07,621 posts Gender: Male Location: Portland, Oregon Report post Posted June 27, 2011For those who may not know, requirements contracts must contain a ""realistic estimated total quantity."" The contract must also contain, when feasible, a ""maximum limit,"" or ""ceiling price."" FAR 16.503 (a). According to FAR 1.108 ( c ): Quote Dollar thresholds. Unless otherwise specified, a specific dollar threshold for the purpose of applicability is the final anticipated dollar value of the action, including the dollar value of all options. If the action establishes a maximum quantity of supplies or services to be acquired or establishes a ceiling price or establishes the final price to be based on future events, the final anticipated dollar value must be the highest final priced alternative to the Government, including the dollar value of all options. Thus, if the contract does include a ""maximum limit"" or ""ceiling price,"" then the contract dollar value for purposes of requiring certified cost or pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.403-4 (a) is the maximum limit or celling price. If the contract does not include a maximum limit or ceiling price, then the dollar value would be the ""estimated total quantity."" "
D2580791	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Europe	Middle Ages	"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Medieval Europe)navigation search This article is about medieval Europe. For a global history of the period between the 5th and 15th centuries, see Post-classical history. For other uses, see Middle Ages (disambiguation). The Cross of Mathilde, a crux gemmata made for Mathilde, Abbess of Essen (973–1011), who is shown kneeling before the Virgin and Child in the enamel plaque. The figure of Christ is slightly later. Probably made in Cologne or Essen, the cross demonstrates several medieval techniques: cast figurative sculpture, filigree, enamelling, gem polishing and setting, and the reuse of Classical cameos and engraved gems. In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages (or Medieval Period) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. Population decline, counterurbanisation, invasion, and movement of peoples, which had begun in Late Antiquity, continued in the Early Middle Ages. The large-scale movements of the Migration Period, including various Germanic peoples, formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire. In the seventh century, North Africa and the Middle East—once part of the Byzantine Empire —came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate, an Islamic empire, after conquest by Muhammad's successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break with classical antiquity was not complete. The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire survived in the east and remained a major power. The empire's law code, the Corpus Juris Civilis or ""Code of Justinian"", was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages. In the West, most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions. Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued. The Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty, briefly established the Carolingian Empire during the later 8th and early 9th century. It covered much of Western Europe but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars combined with external invasions: Vikings from the north, Magyars from the east, and Saracens from the south. During the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised nation states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages. The Late Middle Ages was marked by difficulties and calamities including famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Europe; between 1347 and 1350, the Black Death killed about a third of Europeans. Controversy, heresy, and the Western Schism within the Catholic Church paralleled the interstate conflict, civil strife, and peasant revolts that occurred in the kingdoms. Cultural and technological developments transformed European society, concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the early modern period.

[1]Medieval writers divided history into periods such as the "" Six Ages "" or the "" Four Empires "", and considered their time to be the last before the end of the world. [2] When referring to their own times, they spoke of them as being ""modern"". [3] In the 1330s, the humanist and poet Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (or ""ancient"") and to the Christian period as nova (or ""new""). [4] Leonardo Bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his History of the Florentine People (1442). [5] Bruni and later historians argued that Italy had recovered since Petrarch's time, and therefore added a third period to Petrarch's two. The ""Middle Ages"" first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas or ""middle season"". [6] In early usage, there were many variants, including medium aevum, or ""middle age"", first recorded in 1604, [7] and media saecula, or ""middle ages"", first recorded in 1625. [8] The alternative term ""medieval"" (or occasionally ""mediaeval"" [9] or ""mediæval"") [10] derives from medium aevum. [9] Tripartite periodisation became standard after the German 17th-century historian Christoph Cellarius divided history into three periods: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern. [8]The most commonly given starting point for the Middle Ages is 476, [11] first used by Bruni. [5] [A] For Europe as a whole, 1500 is often considered to be the end of the Middle Ages, [13] but there is no universally agreed upon end date. Depending on the context, events such as Christopher Columbus 's first voyage to the Americas in 1492, the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453, or the Protestant Reformation in 1517 are sometimes used. [14] English historians often use the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 to mark the end of the period. [15] For Spain, dates commonly used are the death of King Ferdinand II in 1516, the death of Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1504, or the conquest of Granada in 1492. [16] Historians from Romance-speaking countries tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts: an earlier ""High"" and later ""Low"" period. English-speaking historians, following their German counterparts, generally subdivide the Middle Ages into three intervals: ""Early"", ""High"", and ""Late"". [1] In the 19th century, the entire Middle Ages were often referred to as the "" Dark Ages "", [17] [B] but with the adoption of these subdivisions, use of this term was restricted to the Early Middle Ages, at least among historians. [2]Later Roman Empire [ edit]Further information: Late Antiquity, Roman Empire, Fall of the Western Roman Empire, and Byzantium under the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties A late Roman sculpture depicting the four Tetrarchs, now in Venice [18]The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the second century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. [19] Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. [20] Military expenses increased steadily during the third century, mainly in response to the war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived in the middle of the third century. [21] The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. [22] The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. [21] More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers. [22]The Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305) split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers, as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other. [23] [C] In 330, after a period of civil war, Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital, Constantinople. [24] Diocletian's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy, reformed taxation, and strengthened the army, which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing: excessive taxation, a declining birthrate, and pressures on its frontiers, among others. [25] Civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century, diverting soldiers from the empire's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach. [26] For much of the 4th century, Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period, with a widening gulf between the rich and poor, and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns. [27] Another change was the Christianisation, or conversion of the empire to Christianity, a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries. [28] [29]Map of the approximate political boundaries in Europe around 450In 376, the Goths, fleeing from the Huns, received permission from Emperor Valens (r. 364–378) to settle in the Roman province of Thracia in the Balkans. The settlement did not go smoothly, and when Roman officials mishandled the situation, the Goths began to raid and plunder. [D] Valens, attempting to put down the disorder, was killed fighting the Goths at the Battle of Adrianople on 9 August 378. [31] As well as the threat from such tribal confederacies from the north, internal divisions within the empire, especially within the Christian Church, caused problems. [32] In 400, the Visigoths invaded the Western Roman Empire and, although briefly forced back from Italy, in 410 sacked the city of Rome. [33] In 406 the Alans, Vandals, and Suevi crossed into Gaul; over the next three years they spread across Gaul and in 409 crossed the Pyrenees Mountains into modern-day Spain. [34] The Migration Period began, when various peoples, initially largely Germanic peoples, moved across Europe. The Franks, Alemanni, and the Burgundians all ended up in northern Gaul while the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes settled in Britain, [35] and the Vandals went on to cross the strait of Gibraltar after which they conquered the province of Africa. [36] In the 430s the Huns began invading the empire; their king Attila (r. 434–453) led invasions into the Balkans in 442 and 447, Gaul in 451, and Italy in 452. [37] The Hunnic threat remained until Attila's death in 453, when the Hunnic confederation he led fell apart. [38] These invasions by the tribes completely changed the political and demographic nature of what had been the Western Roman Empire. [35]By the end of the 5th century the western section of the empire was divided into smaller political units, ruled by the tribes that had invaded in the early part of the century. [39] The deposition of the last emperor of the west, Romulus Augustulus, in 476 has traditionally marked the end of the Western Roman Empire. [12] [E] By 493 the Italian peninsula was conquered by the Ostrogoths. [40] The Eastern Roman Empire, often referred to as the Byzantine Empire after the fall of its western counterpart, had little ability to assert control over the lost western territories. The Byzantine emperors maintained a claim over the territory, but while none of the new kings in the west dared to elevate himself to the position of emperor of the west, Byzantine control of most of the Western Empire could not be sustained; the reconquest of the Mediterranean periphery and the Italian Peninsula ( Gothic War) in the reign of Justinian (r. 527–565) was the sole, and temporary, exception. [41]Early Middle Ages [ edit]Main article: Early Middle Ages New societies [ edit]Main articles: Migration Period and fall of the Western Roman Empire The political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire. Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as ""invasions"", they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the Western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. [42] The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Aetius (d. 454), Aspar (d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472), or Gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background. When the line of Western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. [43] This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the Roman state. [44] Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar, and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects. [45] Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions. [46] An important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities. Many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes, instead relying on granting them land or rents. This meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the taxation systems decayed. [47] Warfare was common between and within the kingdoms. Slavery declined as the supply weakened, and society became more rural. [48] [F]A coin of the Ostrogothic leader Theoderic the Great, struck in Milan, circa AD 491–501Between the 5th and 8th centuries, new peoples and individuals filled the political void left by Roman centralised government. [46] The Ostrogoths, a Gothic tribe, settled in Roman Italy in the late fifth century under Theoderic the Great (d. 526) and set up a kingdom marked by its co-operation between the Italians and the Ostrogoths, at least until the last years of Theodoric's reign. [50] The Burgundians settled in Gaul, and after an earlier realm was destroyed by the Huns in 436 formed a new kingdom in the 440s. Between today's Geneva and Lyon, it grew to become the realm of Burgundy in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. [51] Elsewhere in Gaul, the Franks and Celtic Britons set up small polities. Francia was centred in northern Gaul, and the first king of whom much is known is Childeric I (d. 481). His grave was discovered in 1653 and is remarkable for its grave goods, which included weapons and a large quantity of gold. [52]Under Childeric's son Clovis I (r. 509–511), the founder of the Merovingian dynasty, the Frankish kingdom expanded and converted to Christianity. The Britons, related to the natives of Britannia – modern-day Great Britain – settled in what is now Brittany. [53] [G] Other monarchies were established by the Visigothic Kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula, the Suebi in northwestern Iberia, and the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa. [51] In the sixth century, the Lombards settled in Northern Italy, replacing the Ostrogothic kingdom with a grouping of duchies that occasionally selected a king to rule over them all. By the late sixth century, this arrangement had been replaced by a permanent monarchy, the Kingdom of the Lombards. [54]The invasions brought new ethnic groups to Europe, although some regions received a larger influx of new peoples than others. In Gaul for instance, the invaders settled much more extensively in the north-east than in the south-west. Slavs settled in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula. The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages. Latin, the literary language of the Western Roman Empire, was gradually replaced by vernacular languages which evolved from Latin, but were distinct from it, collectively known as Romance languages. These changes from Latin to the new languages took many centuries. Greek remained the language of the Byzantine Empire, but the migrations of the Slavs added Slavic languages to Eastern Europe. [55]Byzantine survival [ edit]Main articles: Byzantine Empire under the Justinian dynasty and Byzantine Empire under the Heraclian dynasty A mosaic showing Justinian with the bishop of Ravenna, bodyguards, and courtiers. [56]As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with the Sasanian Empire, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in Eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Codex Theodosianus —was completed in 438. [57] Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. [58] Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, [59] under Belisarius (d. 565). [60] The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests. [59]At the Emperor's death, the Byzantines had control of most of Italy, North Africa, and a small foothold in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and setting the stage for the early Muslim conquests, but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult. [61]In the Eastern Empire the slow infiltration of the Balkans by the Slavs added a further difficulty for Justinian's successors. It began gradually, but by the late 540s Slavic tribes were in Thrace and Illyrium, and had defeated an imperial army near Adrianople in 551. In the 560s the Avars began to expand from their base on the north bank of the Danube; by the end of the 6th century they were the dominant power in Central Europe and routinely able to force the Eastern emperors to pay tribute. They remained a strong power until 796. [62]An additional problem to face the empire came as a result of the involvement of Emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) in Persian politics when he intervened in a succession dispute. This led to a period of peace, but when Maurice was overthrown, the Persians invaded and during the reign of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641) controlled large chunks of the empire, including Egypt, Syria, and Anatolia until Heraclius' successful counterattack. In 628 the empire secured a peace treaty and recovered all of its lost territories. [63]Western society [ edit]See also: Early medieval European dress and Medieval cuisine In Western Europe, some of the older Roman elite families died out while others became more involved with ecclesiastical than secular affairs. Values attached to Latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained important, it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status. In the 4th century, Jerome (d. 420) dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading Cicero than the Bible. By the 6th century, Gregory of Tours (d. 594) had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning shorthand. [64] By the late 6th century, the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book. [65] Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship, but some original works were created, along with now-lost oral compositions. The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris (d. 489), Cassiodorus (d. c. 585), and Boethius (d. c. 525) were typical of the age. [66]Changes also took place among laymen, as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls rather than on literary pursuits. Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed the backbone of the military forces. [H] Family ties within the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society, examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul. Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of compensation. [69] Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers of men, with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul. In Anglo-Saxon society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers, but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries. Only in Italy does it appear that women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative. [70]Reconstruction of an early medieval peasant village in Bavaria Peasant society is much less documented than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most of the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. [71] Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. [72] Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. [73] Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord. [74]Roman city life and culture changed greatly in the early Middle Ages. Although Italian cities remained inhabited, they contracted significantly in size. Rome, for instance, shrank from a population of hundreds of thousands to around 30,000 by the end of the 6th century. Roman temples were converted into Christian churches and city walls remained in use. [75] In Northern Europe, cities also shrank, while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials. The establishment of new kingdoms often meant some growth for the towns chosen as capitals. [76] Although there had been Jewish communities in many Roman cities, the Jews suffered periods of persecution after the conversion of the empire to Christianity. Officially they were tolerated, if subject to conversion efforts, and at times were even encouraged to settle in new areas. [77]Rise of Islam [ edit]Main article: Early Muslim conquests The early Muslim conquests Expansion under Muhammad, 622–632Expansion during the Patriarchal Caliphate, 632–661Expansion during the Umayyad Caliphate, 661–750Religious beliefs in the Eastern Empire and Iran were in flux during the late sixth and early seventh centuries. Judaism was an active proselytising faith, and at least one Arab political leader converted to it. [I] Christianity had active missions competing with the Persians' Zoroastrianism in seeking converts, especially among residents of the Arabian Peninsula. All these strands came together with the emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad (d. 632). [79] After his death, Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Empire and Persia, starting with Syria in 634–635 and reaching Egypt in 640–641, Persia between 637 and 642, North Africa in the later seventh century, and the Iberian Peninsula in 711. [80] By 714, Islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called Al-Andalus. [81]The Islamic conquests reached their peak in the mid-eighth century. The defeat of Muslim forces at the Battle of Tours in 732 led to the reconquest of southern France by the Franks, but the main reason for the halt of Islamic growth in Europe was the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate and its replacement by the Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbasids moved their capital to Baghdad and were more concerned with the Middle East than Europe, losing control of sections of the Muslim lands. Umayyad descendants took over the Iberian Peninsula, the Aghlabids controlled North Africa, and the Tulunids became rulers of Egypt. [82] By the middle of the 8th century, new trading patterns were emerging in the Mediterranean; trade between the Franks and the Arabs replaced the old Roman economy. Franks traded timber, furs, swords and slaves in return for silks and other fabrics, spices, and precious metals from the Arabs. [83]Trade and economy [ edit]Main article: Medieval economic history The migrations and invasions of the 4th and 5th centuries disrupted trade networks around the Mediterranean. African goods stopped being imported into Europe, first disappearing from the interior and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as Rome or Naples. By the end of the 7th century, under the impact of the Muslim conquests, African products were no longer found in Western Europe. The replacement of goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands that happened in the Early Middle Ages. This was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the Mediterranean, such as northern Gaul or Britain. Non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods. In the northern parts of Europe, not only were the trade networks local, but the goods carried were simple, with little pottery or other complex products. Around the Mediterranean, pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium-range networks, not just produced locally. [84]The various Germanic states in the west all had coinages that imitated existing Roman and Byzantine forms. Gold continued to be minted until the end of the 7th century, when it was replaced by silver coins. The basic Frankish silver coin was the denarius or denier, while the Anglo-Saxon version was called a penny. From these areas, the denier or penny spread throughout Europe during the centuries from 700 to 1000. Copper or bronze coins were not struck, nor were gold except in Southern Europe. No silver coins denominated in multiple units were minted. [85]Church and monasticism [ edit]An 11th-century illustration of Gregory the Great dictating to a secretary Christianity was a major unifying factor between Eastern and Western Europe before the Arab conquests, but the conquest of North Africa sundered maritime connections between those areas. Increasingly the Byzantine Church differed in language, practices, and liturgy from the Western Church. The Eastern Church used Greek instead of the Western Latin. Theological and political differences emerged, and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as iconoclasm, clerical marriage, and state control of the Church had widened to the extent that the cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities. [86] The formal break, known as the East–West Schism, came in 1054, when the papacy and the patriarchy of Constantinople clashed over papal supremacy and excommunicated each other, which led to the division of Christianity into two Churches—the Western branch became the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern branch the Eastern Orthodox Church. [87]The ecclesiastical structure of the Roman Empire survived the movements and invasions in the west mostly intact, but the papacy was little regarded, and few of the Western bishops looked to the bishop of Rome for religious or political leadership. Many of the popes prior to 750 were more concerned with Byzantine affairs and Eastern theological controversies. The register, or archived copies of the letters, of Pope Gregory the Great (pope 590–604) survived, and of those more than 850 letters, the vast majority were concerned with affairs in Italy or Constantinople. The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain, where Gregory had sent the Gregorian mission in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. [88] Irish missionaries were most active in Western Europe between the 5th and the 7th centuries, going first to England and Scotland and then on to the continent. Under such monks as Columba (d. 597) and Columbanus (d. 615), they founded monasteries, taught in Latin and Greek, and authored secular and religious works. [89]The Early Middle Ages witnessed the rise of monasticism in the West. The shape of European monasticism was determined by traditions and ideas that originated with the Desert Fathers of Egypt and Syria. Most European monasteries were of the type that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life, called cenobitism, which was pioneered by Pachomius (d. 348) in the 4th century. Monastic ideals spread from Egypt to Western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries through hagiographical literature such as the Life of Anthony. [90] Benedict of Nursia (d. 547) wrote the Benedictine Rule for Western monasticism during the 6th century, detailing the administrative and spiritual responsibilities of a community of monks led by an abbot. [91] Monks and monasteries had a deep effect on the religious and political life of the Early Middle Ages, in various cases acting as land trusts for powerful families, centres of propaganda and royal support in newly conquered regions, and bases for missions and proselytisation. [92] They were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region. Many of the surviving manuscripts of the Latin classics were copied in monasteries in the Early Middle Ages. [93] Monks were also the authors of new works, including history, theology, and other subjects, written by authors such as Bede (d. 735), a native of northern England who wrote in the late 7th and early 8th centuries. [94]Carolingian Europe [ edit]Main articles: Francia and Carolingian Empire Map showing growth of Frankish power from 481 to 814The Frankish kingdom in northern Gaul split into kingdoms called Austrasia, Neustria, and Burgundy during the 6th and 7th centuries, all of them ruled by the Merovingian dynasty, who were descended from Clovis. The 7th century was a tumultuous period of wars between Austrasia and Neustria. [95] Such warfare was exploited by Pippin (d. 640), the Mayor of the Palace for Austrasia who became the power behind the Austrasian throne. Later members of his family inherited the office, acting as advisers and regents. One of his descendants, Charles Martel (d. 741), won the Battle of Poitiers in 732, halting the advance of Muslim armies across the Pyrenees. [96] [J] Great Britain was divided into small states dominated by the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, and East Anglia, which were descended from the Anglo-Saxon invaders. Smaller kingdoms in present-day Wales and Scotland were still under the control of the native Britons and Picts. [98] Ireland was divided into even smaller political units, usually known as tribal kingdoms, under the control of kings. There were perhaps as many as 150 local kings in Ireland, of varying importance. [99]The Carolingian dynasty, as the successors to Charles Martel are known, officially took control of the kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria in a coup of 753 led by Pippin III (r. 752–768). A contemporary chronicle claims that Pippin sought, and gained, authority for this coup from Pope Stephen II (pope 752–757). Pippin's takeover was reinforced with propaganda that portrayed the Merovingians as inept or cruel rulers, exalted the accomplishments of Charles Martel, and circulated stories of the family's great piety. At the time of his death in 768, Pippin left his kingdom in the hands of his two sons, Charles (r. 768–814) and Carloman (r. 768–771). When Carloman died of natural causes, Charles blocked the succession of Carloman's young son and installed himself as the king of the united Austrasia and Neustria. Charles, more often known as Charles the Great or Charlemagne, embarked upon a programme of systematic expansion in 774 that unified a large portion of Europe, eventually controlling modern-day France, northern Italy, and Saxony. In the wars that lasted beyond 800, he rewarded allies with war booty and command over parcels of land. [100] In 774, Charlemagne conquered the Lombards, which freed the papacy from the fear of Lombard conquest and marked the beginnings of the Papal States. [101] [K]Charlemagne's palace chapel at Aachen, completed in 805 [103]The coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 is regarded as a turning point in medieval history, marking a return of the Western Roman Empire, since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the Western emperors. [104] It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state. [105] There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. [104] The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into. Clergy and local bishops served as officials, as well as the imperial officials called missi dominici, who served as roving inspectors and troubleshooters. [106]Carolingian Renaissance [ edit]Main article: Carolingian Renaissance Charlemagne's court in Aachen was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes referred to as the "" Carolingian Renaissance "". Literacy increased, as did development in the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, as well as liturgical and scriptural studies. The English monk Alcuin (d. 804) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne's chancery —or writing office—made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule, [L] allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy, imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encouraging learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced. [108] Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language, changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the Church and government. By the reign of Charlemagne, the language had so diverged from the classical that it was later called Medieval Latin. [109]Breakup of the Carolingian Empire [ edit]Main articles: Holy Roman Empire and Viking Age Territorial divisions of the Carolingian Empire in 843, 855, and 870Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos. [110]A three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. [110] Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. [111] [M] In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. [N] [O] In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, with the death of Louis the Child, [114] and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r. 911–918) as king. [115]The breakup of the Carolingian Empire was accompanied by invasions, migrations, and raids by external foes. The Atlantic and northern shores were harassed by the Vikings, who also raided the British Isles and settled there as well as in Iceland. In 911, the Viking chieftain Rollo (d. c. 931) received permission from the Frankish King Charles the Simple (r. 898–922) to settle in what became Normandy. [116] [P] The eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms, especially Germany and Italy, were under continual Magyar assault until the invader's defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. [118] The breakup of the Abbasid dynasty meant that the Islamic world fragmented into smaller political states, some of which began expanding into Italy and Sicily, as well as over the Pyrenees into the southern parts of the Frankish kingdoms. [119]New kingdoms and Byzantine revival [ edit]Main articles: Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty, Byzantine Empire under the Isaurian dynasty, First Bulgarian Empire, Christianisation of Bulgaria, Kingdom of Germany, Christianisation of Scandinavia, and Christianisation of Kievan Rus'See also: Byzantine–Arab wars (780–1180) and Byzantine–Bulgarian wars Europe in 814Efforts by local kings to fight the invaders led to the formation of new political entities. In Anglo-Saxon England, King Alfred the Great (r. 871–899) came to an agreement with the Viking invaders in the late 9th century, resulting in Danish settlements in Northumbria, Mercia, and parts of East Anglia. [120] By the middle of the 10th century, Alfred's successors had conquered Northumbria, and restored English control over most of the southern part of Great Britain. [121] In northern Britain, Kenneth Mac Alpin (d. c. 860) united the Picts and the Scots into the Kingdom of Alba. [122] In the early 10th century, the Ottonian dynasty had established itself in Germany, and was engaged in driving back the Magyars. Its efforts culminated in the coronation in 962 of Otto I (r. 936–973) as Holy Roman Emperor. [123] In 972, he secured recognition of his title by the Byzantine Empire, which he sealed with the marriage of his son Otto II (r. 967–983) to Theophanu (d. 991), daughter of an earlier Byzantine Emperor Romanos II (r. 959–963). [124] By the late 10th century Italy had been drawn into the Ottonian sphere after a period of instability; [125] Otto III (r. 996–1002) spent much of his later reign in the kingdom. [126] The western Frankish kingdom was more fragmented, and although kings remained nominally in charge, much of the political power devolved to the local lords. [127]Missionary efforts to Scandinavia during the 9th and 10th centuries helped strengthen the growth of kingdoms such as Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, which gained power and territory. Some kings converted to Christianity, although not all by 1000. Scandinavians also expanded and colonised throughout Europe. Besides the settlements in Ireland, England, and Normandy, further settlement took place in what became Russia and in Iceland. Swedish traders and raiders ranged down the rivers of the Russian steppe, and even attempted to seize Constantinople in 860 and 907. [128] Christian Spain, initially driven into a small section of the peninsula in the north, expanded slowly south during the 9th and 10th centuries, establishing the kingdoms of Asturias and León. [129]10th-century Ottonian ivory plaque depicting Christ receiving a church from Otto IIn Eastern Europe, Byzantium revived its fortunes under Emperor Basil I (r. 867–886) and his successors Leo VI (r. 886–912) and Constantine VII (r. 913–959), members of the Macedonian dynasty. Commerce revived and the emperors oversaw the extension of a uniform administration to all the provinces. The military was reorganised, which allowed the emperors John I (r. 969–976) and Basil II (r. 976–1025) to expand the frontiers of the empire on all fronts. The imperial court was the centre of a revival of classical learning, a process known as the Macedonian Renaissance. Writers such as John Geometres ( fl. early 10th century) composed new hymns, poems, and other works. [130] Missionary efforts by both Eastern and Western clergy resulted in the conversion of the Moravians, Bulgars, Bohemians, Poles, Magyars, and Slavic inhabitants of the Kievan Rus'. These conversions contributed to the founding of political states in the lands of those peoples—the states of Moravia, Bulgaria, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, and the Kievan Rus'. [131] Bulgaria, which was founded around 680, at its height reached from Budapest to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River in modern Ukraine to the Adriatic Sea. [132] By 1018, the last Bulgarian nobles had surrendered to the Byzantine Empire. [133]Art and architecture [ edit]Main articles: Medieval art and Medieval architecture See also: Migration Period art, Pre-Romanesque art and architecture, and Carolingian art A page from the Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript created in the British Isles in the late 8th or early 9th century [134]Few large stone buildings were constructed between the Constantinian basilicas of the 4th century and the 8th century, although many smaller ones were built during the 6th and 7th centuries. By the beginning of the 8th century, the Carolingian Empire revived the basilica form of architecture. [135] One feature of the basilica is the use of a transept, [136] or the ""arms"" of a cross-shaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave. [137] Other new features of religious architecture include the crossing tower and a monumental entrance to the church, usually at the west end of the building. [138]Carolingian art was produced for a small group of figures around the court, and the monasteries and churches they supported. It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art, but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles. Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down. [139] [140] Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art, but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and finds such as the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain and Nagyszentmiklós near Byzantine territory. There are survivals from the large brooches in fibula or penannular form that were a key piece of personal adornment for elites, including the Irish Tara Brooch. [141] Highly decorated books were mostly Gospel Books and these have survived in larger numbers, including the Insular Book of Kells, the Book of Lindisfarne, and the imperial Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, which is one of the few to retain its "" treasure binding "" of gold encrusted with jewels. [142] Charlemagne's court seems to have been responsible for the acceptance of figurative monumental sculpture in Christian art, [143] and by the end of the period near life-sized figures such as the Gero Cross were common in important churches. [144]Military and technological developments [ edit]During the later Roman Empire, the principal military developments were attempts to create an effective cavalry force as well as the continued development of highly specialised types of troops. The creation of heavily armoured cataphract -type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the 5th-century Roman military. The various invading tribes had differing emphasis on types of soldiers—ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies. [145] During the early invasion period, the stirrup had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because it was not possible to put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider. [146] The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier, and weaker, Scythian composite bow. [147] Another development was the increasing use of longswords [148] and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and lamellar armour. [149]The importance of infantry and light cavalry began to decline during the early Carolingian period, with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry. The use of militia-type levies of the free population declined over the Carolingian period. [150] Although much of the Carolingian armies were mounted, a large proportion during the early period appear to have been mounted infantry, rather than true cavalry. [151] One exception was Anglo-Saxon England, where the armies were still composed of regional levies, known as the fyrd, which were led by the local elites. [152] In military technology, one of the main changes was the return of the crossbow, which had been known in Roman times and reappeared as a military weapon during the last part of the Early Middle Ages. [153] Another change was the introduction of the stirrup, which increased the effectiveness of cavalry as shock troops. A technological advance that had implications beyond the military was the horseshoe, which allowed horses to be used in rocky terrain. [154]High Middle Ages [ edit]Main article: High Middle Ages Society and economic life [ edit]Medieval French manuscript illustration of the three classes of medieval society: those who prayed (the clergy) those who fought (the knights ), and those who worked (the peasantry ). [155] The relationship between these classes was governed by feudalism and manorialism. [156] ( Li Livres dou Sante, 13th century)The High Middle Ages was a period of tremendous expansion of population. The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million between 1000 and 1347, although the exact causes remain unclear: improved agricultural techniques, the decline of slaveholding, a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested. [157] [158] As much as 90 per cent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or villages. [158] These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as manorialism. There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond, [159] with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north. The practice of assarting, or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them, also contributed to the expansion of population. [160]Other sections of society included the nobility, clergy, and townsmen. Nobles, both the titled nobility and simple knights, exploited the manors and the peasants, although they did not own lands outright but were granted rights to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the system of feudalism. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these lands, or fiefs, came to be considered hereditary, and in most areas they were no longer divisible between all the heirs as had been the case in the early medieval period. Instead, most fiefs and lands went to the eldest son. [161] [Q] The dominance of the nobility was built upon its control of the land, its military service as heavy cavalry, control of castles, and various immunities from taxes or other impositions. [R] Castles, initially in wood but later in stone, began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries in response to the disorder of the time, and provided protection from invaders as well as allowing lords defence from rivals. Control of castles allowed the nobles to defy kings or other overlords. [163] Nobles were stratified; kings and the highest-ranking nobility controlled large numbers of commoners and large tracts of land, as well as other nobles. Beneath them, lesser nobles had authority over smaller areas of land and fewer people. Knights were the lowest level of nobility; they controlled but did not own land, and had to serve other nobles. [164] [S]The clergy was divided into two types: the secular clergy, who lived out in the world, and the regular clergy, who lived under a religious rule and were usually monks. [166] Throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population, usually less than one per cent. [167] Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the nobility, the same social class that served as the recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy. The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class. [168] Townsmen were in a somewhat unusual position, as they did not fit into the traditional three-fold division of society into nobles, clergy, and peasants. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded. [169] But throughout the Middle Ages the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 per cent of the total population. [170]13th-century illustration of a Jew (in pointed Jewish hat) and the Christian Petrus Alphonsi debating Jews also spread across Europe during the period. Communities were established in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries, but Spanish Jews, long settled in Spain under the Muslims, came under Christian rule and increasing pressure to convert to Christianity. [77] Most Jews were confined to the cities, as they were not allowed to own land or be peasants. [171] [T] Besides the Jews, there were other non-Christians on the edges of Europe—pagan Slavs in Eastern Europe and Muslims in Southern Europe. [172]Women in the Middle Ages were officially required to be subordinate to some male, whether their father, husband, or other kinsman. Widows, who were often allowed much control over their own lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work. [173] Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. [174] Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs. The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns, as they were unable to become priests. [173]In central and northern Italy and in Flanders, the rise of towns that were to a degree self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities on the shores of the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League, and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean. [U] Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants. [176] In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders, Marco Polo (d. 1324). [177] Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields, which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. [178] Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared among merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money. [179]Rise of state power [ edit]Main articles: England in the Middle Ages, France in the Middle Ages, Germany in the Middle Ages, Italy in the Middle Ages, Scotland in the Middle Ages, Spain in the Middle Ages, and Poland in the Middle Ages Europe and the Mediterranean Sea in 1190The High Middle Ages was the formative period in the history of the modern Western state. Kings in France, England, and Spain consolidated their power, and set up lasting governing institutions. [180] New kingdoms such as Hungary and Poland, after their conversion to Christianity, became Central European powers. [181] The Magyars settled Hungary around 900 under King Árpád (d. c. 907) after a series of invasions in the 9th century. [182] The papacy, long attached to an ideology of independence from secular kings, first asserted its claim to temporal authority over the entire Christian world; the Papal Monarchy reached its apogee in the early 13th century under the pontificate of Innocent III (pope 1198–1216). [183] Northern Crusades and the advance of Christian kingdoms and military orders into previously pagan regions in the Baltic and Finnic north-east brought the forced assimilation of numerous native peoples into European culture. [184]During the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over Church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. [185] His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. [186] Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. [187] Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. [188] He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287. [189]The Bayeux Tapestry (detail) showing William the Conqueror (centre), his half-brothers Robert, Count of Mortain (right) and Odo, Bishop of Bayeux in the Duchy of Normandy (left)Under the Capetian dynasty the French monarchy slowly began to expand its authority over the nobility, growing out of the Île-de-France to exert control over more of the country in the 11th and 12th centuries. [190] They faced a powerful rival in the Dukes of Normandy, who in 1066 under William the Conqueror (duke 1035–1087), conquered England (r. 1066–87) and created a cross-channel empire that lasted, in various forms, throughout the rest of the Middle Ages. [191] [192] Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy, when Robert Guiscard (d. 1085) landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the Kingdom of Sicily. [193] Under the Angevin dynasty of Henry II (r. 1154–89) and his son Richard I (r. 1189–99), the kings of England ruled over England and large areas of France, [194] [V] brought to the family by Henry II's marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine (d. 1204), heiress to much of southern France. [196] [W] Richard's younger brother John (r. 1199–1216) lost Normandy and the rest of the northern French possessions in 1204 to the French King Philip II Augustus (r. 1180–1223). This led to dissension among the English nobility, while John's financial exactions to pay for his unsuccessful attempts to regain Normandy led in 1215 to Magna Carta, a charter that confirmed the rights and privileges of free men in England. Under Henry III (r. 1216–72), John's son, further concessions were made to the nobility, and royal power was diminished. [197] The French monarchy continued to make gains against the nobility during the late 12th and 13th centuries, bringing more territories within the kingdom under the king's personal rule and centralising the royal administration. [198] Under Louis IX (r. 1226–70), royal prestige rose to new heights as Louis served as a mediator for most of Europe. [199] [X]In Iberia, the Christian states, which had been confined to the north-western part of the peninsula, began to push back against the Islamic states in the south, a period known as the Reconquista. [201] By about 1150, the Christian north had coalesced into the five major kingdoms of León, Castile, Aragon, Navarre, and Portugal. [202] Southern Iberia remained under control of Islamic states, initially under the Caliphate of Córdoba, which broke up in 1031 into a shifting number of petty states known as taifas, [201] who fought with the Christians until the Almohad Caliphate re-established centralised rule over Southern Iberia in the 1170s. [203] Christian forces advanced again in the early 13th century, culminating in the capture of Seville in 1248. [204]Crusades [ edit]Main articles: Crusades, Reconquista, and Northern Crusades See also: Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty and Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty Krak des Chevaliers was built during the Crusades for the Knights Hospitallers. [205]In the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks took over much of the Middle East, occupying Persia during the 1040s, Armenia in the 1060s, and Jerusalem in 1070. In 1071, the Turkish army defeated the Byzantine army at the Battle of Manzikert and captured the Byzantine Emperor Romanus IV (r. 1068–71). The Turks were then free to invade Asia Minor, which dealt a dangerous blow to the Byzantine Empire by seizing a large part of its population and its economic heartland. Although the Byzantines regrouped and recovered somewhat, they never fully regained Asia Minor and were often on the defensive. The Turks also had difficulties, losing control of Jerusalem to the Fatimids of Egypt and suffering from a series of internal civil wars. [206] The Byzantines also faced a revived Bulgaria, which in the late 12th and 13th centuries spread throughout the Balkans. [207]The crusades were intended to seize Jerusalem from Muslim control. The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II (pope 1088–99) at the Council of Clermont in 1095 in response to a request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) for aid against further Muslim advances. Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. [208] One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, [77] when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction. [209] Another outgrowth of the crusades was the foundation of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, which fused monastic life with military service. [210]The crusaders consolidated their conquests into crusader states. During the 12th and 13th centuries, there were a series of conflicts between those states and the surrounding Islamic states. Appeals from those states to the papacy led to further crusades, [208] such as the Third Crusade, called to try to regain Jerusalem, which had been captured by Saladin (d. 1193) in 1187. [211] [Y] In 1203, the Fourth Crusade was diverted from the Holy Land to Constantinople, and captured the city in 1204, setting up a Latin Empire of Constantinople [213] and greatly weakening the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines recaptured the city in 1261, but never regained their former strength. [214] By 1291 all the crusader states had been captured or forced from the mainland, although a titular Kingdom of Jerusalem survived on the island of Cyprus for several years afterwards. [215]Popes called for crusades to take place elsewhere besides the Holy Land: in Spain, southern France, and along the Baltic. [208] The Spanish crusades became fused with the Reconquista of Spain from the Muslims. Although the Templars and Hospitallers took part in the Spanish crusades, similar Spanish military religious orders were founded, most of which had become part of the two main orders of Calatrava and Santiago by the beginning of the 12th century. [216] Northern Europe also remained outside Christian influence until the 11th century or later, and became a crusading venue as part of the Northern Crusades of the 12th to 14th centuries. These crusades also spawned a military order, the Order of the Sword Brothers. Another order, the Teutonic Knights, although founded in the crusader states, focused much of its activity in the Baltic after 1225, and in 1309 moved its headquarters to Marienburg in Prussia. [217]Intellectual life [ edit]Main articles: Renaissance of the 12th century, Medieval philosophy, Medieval literature, Medieval poetry, and Medieval medicine of Western Europe During the 11th century, developments in philosophy and theology led to increased intellectual activity. There was debate between the realists and the nominalists over the concept of "" universals "". Philosophical discourse was stimulated by the rediscovery of Aristotle and his emphasis on empiricism and rationalism. Scholars such as Peter Abelard (d. 1142) and Peter Lombard (d. 1164) introduced Aristotelian logic into theology. In the late 11th and early 12th centuries cathedral schools spread throughout Western Europe, signalling the shift of learning from monasteries to cathedrals and towns. [218] Cathedral schools were in turn replaced by the universities established in major European cities. [219] Philosophy and theology fused in scholasticism, an attempt by 12th- and 13th-century scholars to reconcile authoritative texts, most notably Aristotle and the Bible. This movement tried to employ a systemic approach to truth and reason [220] and culminated in the thought of Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274), who wrote the Summa Theologica, or Summary of Theology. [221]A medieval scholar making precise measurements in a 14th-century manuscript illustration Chivalry and the ethos of courtly love developed in royal and noble courts. This culture was expressed in the vernacular languages rather than Latin, and comprised poems, stories, legends, and popular songs spread by troubadours, or wandering minstrels. Often the stories were written down in the chansons de geste, or ""songs of great deeds"", such as The Song of Roland or The Song of Hildebrand. [222] Secular and religious histories were also produced. [223] Geoffrey of Monmouth (d. c. 1155) composed his Historia Regum Britanniae, a collection of stories and legends about Arthur. [224] Other works were more clearly history, such as Otto von Freising 's (d. 1158) Gesta Friderici Imperatoris detailing the deeds of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, or William of Malmesbury 's (d. c. 1143) Gesta Regum on the kings of England. [223]Legal studies advanced during the 12th century. Both secular law and canon law, or ecclesiastical law, were studied in the High Middle Ages. Secular law, or Roman law, was advanced greatly by the discovery of the Corpus Juris Civilis in the 11th century, and by 1100 Roman law was being taught at Bologna. This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe. Canon law was also studied, and around 1140 a monk named Gratian (fl. 12th century), a teacher at Bologna, wrote what became the standard text of canon law—the Decretum. [225]Among the results of the Greek and Islamic influence on this period in European history was the replacement of Roman numerals with the decimal positional number system and the invention of algebra, which allowed more advanced mathematics. Astronomy advanced following the translation of Ptolemy 's Almagest from Greek into Latin in the late 12th century. Medicine was also studied, especially in southern Italy, where Islamic medicine influenced the school at Salerno. [226]Technology and military [ edit]Main articles: Medieval technology, Medieval warfare, and History of science § Science in the Middle Ages Further information: List of medieval European scientists Portrait of Cardinal Hugh of Saint-Cher by Tommaso da Modena, 1352, the first known depiction of spectacles [227]In the 12th and 13th centuries, Europe produced economic growth and innovations in methods of production. Major technological advances included the invention of the windmill, the first mechanical clocks, the manufacture of distilled spirits, and the use of the astrolabe. [228] Concave spectacles were invented around 1286 by an unknown Italian artisan, probably working in or near Pisa. [229]The development of a three-field rotation system for planting crops [158] [Z] increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system, with a consequent increase in production. [230] The development of the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, aided by the spread of the horse collar, which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen. Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture, factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system. [231]The construction of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology, leading to the development of large stone buildings. Ancillary structures included new town halls, houses, bridges, and tithe barns. [232] Shipbuilding improved with the use of the rib and plank method rather than the old Roman system of mortise and tenon. Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the stern-post rudder, both of which increased the speed at which ships could be sailed. [233]In military affairs, the use of infantry with specialised roles increased. Along with the still-dominant heavy cavalry, armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen, as well as sappers and engineers. [234] Crossbows, which had been known in Late Antiquity, increased in use partly because of the increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries. [153] [AA] The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed-face helmets, heavy body armour, as well as horse armour. [236] Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid-13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304, although it was merely used as an explosive and not as a weapon. Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s, and hand-held guns were in use by the 1360s. [237]Architecture, art, and music [ edit]Further information: Medieval architecture, Medieval art, and Medieval music The Romanesque Church of Maria Laach, Germany In the 10th century the establishment of churches and monasteries led to the development of stone architecture that elaborated vernacular Roman forms, from which the term ""Romanesque"" is derived. Where available, Roman brick and stone buildings were recycled for their materials. From the tentative beginnings known as the First Romanesque, the style flourished and spread across Europe in a remarkably homogeneous form. Just before 1000 there was a great wave of building stone churches all over Europe. [238] Romanesque buildings have massive stone walls, openings topped by semi-circular arches, small windows, and, particularly in France, arched stone vaults. [239] The large portal with coloured sculpture in high relief became a central feature of façades, especially in France, and the capitals of columns were often carved with narrative scenes of imaginative monsters and animals. [240] According to art historian C. R. Dodwell, ""virtually all the churches in the West were decorated with wall-paintings"", of which few survive. [241] Simultaneous with the development in church architecture, the distinctive European form of the castle was developed, and became crucial to politics and warfare. [242]Romanesque art, especially metalwork, was at its most sophisticated in Mosan art, in which distinct artistic personalities including Nicholas of Verdun (d. 1205) become apparent, and an almost classical style is seen in works such as a font at Liège, [243] contrasting with the writhing animals of the exactly contemporary Gloucester Candlestick. Large illuminated bibles and psalters were the typical forms of luxury manuscripts, and wall-painting flourished in churches, often following a scheme with a Last Judgement on the west wall, a Christ in Majesty at the east end, and narrative biblical scenes down the nave, or in the best surviving example, at Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe, on the barrel-vaulted roof. [244]The Gothic interior of Laon Cathedral, France From the early 12th century, French builders developed the Gothic style, marked by the use of rib vaults, pointed arches, flying buttresses, and large stained glass windows. It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals, and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe. Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England. [245] Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost all lost. [246]During this period the practice of manuscript illumination gradually passed from monasteries to lay workshops, so that according to Janetta Benton ""by 1300 most monks bought their books in shops"", [247] and the book of hours developed as a form of devotional book for lay-people. Metalwork continued to be the most prestigious form of art, with Limoges enamel a popular and relatively affordable option for objects such as reliquaries and crosses. [248] In Italy the innovations of Cimabue and Duccio, followed by the Trecento master Giotto (d. 1337), greatly increased the sophistication and status of panel painting and fresco. [249] Increasing prosperity during the 12th century resulted in greater production of secular art; many carved ivory objects such as gaming-pieces, combs, and small religious figures have survived. [250]Church life [ edit]Main articles: Gregorian Reform and Church and state in medieval Europe Francis of Assisi, depicted by Bonaventura Berlinghieri in 1235, founded the Franciscan Order. [251]Monastic reform became an important issue during the 11th century, as elites began to worry that monks were not adhering to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life. Cluny Abbey, founded in the Mâcon region of France in 909, was established as part of the Cluniac Reforms, a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear. [252] Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords. [253]Monastic reform inspired change in the secular Church. The ideals that it was based upon were brought to the papacy by Pope Leo IX (pope 1049–1054), and provided the ideology of the clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073–85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms. The dispute represents a significant stage in the creation of a papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities. It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors. [252]Sénanque Abbey, Gordes, France The High Middle Ages was a period of great religious movements. Besides the Crusades and monastic reforms, people sought to participate in new forms of religious life. New monastic orders were founded, including the Carthusians and the Cistercians. The latter especially expanded rapidly in their early years under the guidance of Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153). These new orders were formed in response to the feeling of the laity that Benedictine monasticism no longer met the needs of the laymen, who along with those wishing to enter the religious life wanted a return to the simpler hermetical monasticism of early Christianity, or to live an Apostolic life. [210] Religious pilgrimages were also encouraged. Old pilgrimage sites such as Rome, Jerusalem, and Compostela received increasing numbers of visitors, and new sites such as Monte Gargano and Bari rose to prominence. [254]In the 13th century mendicant orders —the Franciscans and the Dominicans —who swore vows of poverty and earned their living by begging, were approved by the papacy. [255] Religious groups such as the Waldensians and the Humiliati also attempted to return to the life of early Christianity in the middle 12th and early 13th centuries, but they were condemned as heretical by the papacy. Others joined the Cathars, another heretical movement condemned by the papacy. In 1209, a crusade was preached against the Cathars, the Albigensian Crusade, which in combination with the medieval Inquisition, eliminated them. [256]Late Middle Ages [ edit]Main article: Late Middle Ages War, famine, and plague [ edit]Main article: Crisis of the Late Middle Ages The first years of the 14th century were marked by famines, culminating in the Great Famine of 1315–17. [257] The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. [258] The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. [259] The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn. [260]Execution of some of the ringleaders of the jacquerie, from a 14th-century manuscript of the Chroniques de France ou de St Denis These troubles were followed in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe during the following three years. [261] [AB] The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, about one-third of the population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. [AC] Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. [264] Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. [265] Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague throughout the rest of the 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages. [261]Society and economy [ edit]Society throughout Europe was disturbed by the dislocations caused by the Black Death. Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned, as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas. [266] Although serfdom declined in Western Europe it became more common in Eastern Europe, as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free. [267] Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents. [268] The percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined from a high of 90 to closer to 50 per cent by the end of the period. [165] Landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders, and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments. Partly at the urging of landlords, governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death. [268] Non-clergy became increasingly literate, and urban populations began to imitate the nobility's interest in chivalry. [269]Jewish communities were expelled from England in 1290 and from France in 1306. Although some were allowed back into France, most were not, and many Jews emigrated eastwards, settling in Poland and Hungary. [270] The Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, and dispersed to Turkey, France, Italy, and Holland. [77] The rise of banking in Italy during the 13th century continued throughout the 14th century, fuelled partly by the increasing warfare of the period and the needs of the papacy to move money between kingdoms. Many banking firms loaned money to royalty, at great risk, as some were bankrupted when kings defaulted on their loans. [271] [AD]State resurgence [ edit]Map of Europe in 1360Strong, royalty-based nation states rose throughout Europe in the Late Middle Ages, particularly in England, France, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: Aragon, Castile, and Portugal. The long conflicts of the period strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry. Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled. [272] Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient, and the rate of taxation often increased. [273] The requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the English Parliament and the French Estates General to gain power and authority. [274]Joan of Arc in a 15th-century depiction Throughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility. [275] They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, [276] waged from 1337 to 1453. [277] Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327–77) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376), [AE] won the battles of Crécy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France. [AF] The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. [280] In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. [281] The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence. [282] The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War, [283] and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Crécy in 1346. [237]In modern-day Germany, the Holy Roman Empire continued to rule, but the elective nature of the imperial crown meant there was no enduring dynasty around which a strong state could form. [284] Further east, the kingdoms of Poland, Hungary, and Bohemia grew powerful. [285] In Iberia, the Christian kingdoms continued to gain land from the Muslim kingdoms of the peninsula; [286] Portugal concentrated on expanding overseas during the 15th century, while the other kingdoms were riven by difficulties over royal succession and other concerns. [287] [288] After losing the Hundred Years' War, England went on to suffer a long civil war known as the Wars of the Roses, which lasted into the 1490s [288] and only ended when Henry Tudor (r. 1485–1509 as Henry VII) became king and consolidated power with his victory over Richard III (r. 1483–85) at Bosworth in 1485. [289] In Scandinavia, Margaret I of Denmark (r. in Denmark 1387–1412) consolidated Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in the Union of Kalmar, which continued until 1523. The major power around the Baltic Sea was the Hanseatic League, a commercial confederation of city states that traded from Western Europe to Russia. [290] Scotland emerged from English domination under Robert the Bruce (r. 1306–29), who secured papal recognition of his kingship in 1328. [291]Collapse of Byzantium [ edit]Main articles: Decline of the Byzantine Empire, Byzantine Empire under the Angelos dynasty, Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty, Byzantine–Ottoman Wars, and Rise of the Ottoman Empire Although the Palaeologi emperors recaptured Constantinople from the Western Europeans in 1261, they were never able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands. They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople, the city itself, and some coastal lands on the Black Sea and around the Aegean Sea. The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia, the Second Bulgarian Empire and the city-state of Venice. The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe, the Ottomans, who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century. The Ottomans expanded into Europe, reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians in the Balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396; a great army was sent to the Balkans, where it was defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis. [292] Constantinople was finally captured by the Ottomans in 1453. [293]Controversy within the Church [ edit]Guy of Boulogne crowning Pope Gregory XI in a miniature from Froissart's Chroniques During the tumultuous 14th century, disputes within the leadership of the Church led to the Avignon Papacy of 1309–76, [294] also called the ""Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy"" (a reference to the Babylonian captivity of the Jews), [295] and then to the Great Schism, lasting from 1378 to 1418, when there were two and later three rival popes, each supported by several states. [296] Ecclesiastical officials convened at the Council of Constance in 1414, and in the following year the council deposed one of the rival popes, leaving only two claimants. Further depositions followed, and in November 1417 the council elected Martin V (pope 1417–31) as pope. [297]Besides the schism, the Western Church was riven by theological controversies, some of which turned into heresies. John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to Church doctrine. [298] Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. [299] The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite Church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. [300] Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers. [301]The papacy further refined the practice in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued the practices of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief in the power of the Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters. [302]Scholars, intellectuals, and exploration [ edit]See also: Europeans in Medieval China During the Later Middle Ages, theologians such as John Duns Scotus (d. 1308) [AG] and William of Ockham (d. c. 1348), [220] led a reaction against scholasticism, objecting to the application of reason to faith. Their efforts undermined the prevailing Platonic idea of ""universals"". Ockham's insistence that reason operates independently of faith allowed science to be separated from theology and philosophy. [303] Legal studies were marked by the steady advance of Roman law into areas of jurisprudence previously governed by customary law. The lone exception to this trend was in England, where the common law remained pre-eminent. Other countries codified their laws; legal codes were promulgated in Castile, Poland, and Lithuania. [304]Clerics studying astronomy and geometry, French, early 15th century Education remained mostly focused on the training of future clergy. The basic learning of the letters and numbers remained the province of the family or a village priest, but the secondary subjects of the trivium —grammar, rhetoric, logic—were studied in cathedral schools or in schools provided by cities. Commercial secondary schools spread, and some Italian towns had more than one such enterprise. Universities also spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. Lay literacy rates rose, but were still low; one estimate gave a literacy rate of ten per cent of males and one per cent of females in 1500. [305]The publication of vernacular literature increased, with Dante (d. 1321), Petrarch (d. 1374) and Giovanni Boccaccio (d. 1375) in 14th-century Italy, Geoffrey Chaucer (d. 1400) and William Langland (d. c. 1386) in England, and François Villon (d. 1464) and Christine de Pizan (d. c. 1430) in France. Much literature remained religious in character, and although a great deal of it continued to be written in Latin, a new demand developed for saints' lives and other devotional tracts in the vernacular languages. [304] This was fed by the growth of the Devotio Moderna movement, most prominently in the formation of the Brethren of the Common Life, but also in the works of German mystics such as Meister Eckhart and Johannes Tauler (d. 1361). [306] Theatre also developed in the guise of miracle plays put on by the Church. [304] At the end of the period, the development of the printing press in about 1450 led to the establishment of publishing houses throughout Europe by 1500. [307]In the early 15th century, the countries of the Iberian peninsula began to sponsor exploration beyond the boundaries of Europe. Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal (d. 1460) sent expeditions that discovered the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Cape Verde during his lifetime. After his death, exploration continued; Bartolomeu Dias (d. 1500) went around the Cape of Good Hope in 1486 and Vasco da Gama (d. 1524) sailed around Africa to India in 1498. [308] The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored the voyage of exploration by Christopher Columbus (d. 1506) in 1492 that discovered the Americas. [309] The English crown under Henry VII sponsored the voyage of John Cabot (d. 1498) in 1497, which landed on Cape Breton Island. [310]Technological and military developments [ edit]Agricultural calendar, c. 1470, from a manuscript of Pietro de Crescenzi Further information: History of agriculture § Europe One of the major developments in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was the increased use of infantry and light cavalry. [311] The English also employed longbowmen, but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success. [312] Armour continued to advance, spurred by the increasing power of crossbows, and plate armour was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the hand-held guns that were developed. [313] Pole arms reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears. [314]In agriculture, the increased usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun. In addition, the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool, tripling production. [315] [AH] A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily life was the use of buttons as closures for garments, which allowed for better fitting without having to lace clothing on the wearer. [317] Windmills were refined with the creation of the tower mill, allowing the upper part of the windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the wind was blowing. [318] The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality. [319] The first patent law in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions. [320]Late medieval art and architecture [ edit]February scene from the 15th-century illuminated manuscript Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry The Late Middle Ages in Europe as a whole correspond to the Trecento and Early Renaissance cultural periods in Italy. Northern Europe and Spain continued to use Gothic styles, which became increasingly elaborate in the 15th century, until almost the end of the period. International Gothic was a courtly style that reached much of Europe in the decades around 1400, producing masterpieces such as the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. [321] All over Europe secular art continued to increase in quantity and quality, and in the 15th century the mercantile classes of Italy and Flanders became important patrons, commissioning small portraits of themselves in oils as well as a growing range of luxury items such as jewellery, ivory caskets, cassone chests, and maiolica pottery. These objects also included the Hispano-Moresque ware produced by mostly Mudéjar potters in Spain. Although royalty owned huge collections of plate, little survives except for the Royal Gold Cup. [322] Italian silk manufacture developed, so that Western churches and elites no longer needed to rely on imports from Byzantium or the Islamic world. In France and Flanders tapestry weaving of sets like The Lady and the Unicorn became a major luxury industry. [323]The large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building, as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved, as in the Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea. Painted or carved wooden relief altarpieces became common, especially as churches created many side-chapels. Early Netherlandish painting by artists such as Jan van Eyck (d. 1441) and Rogier van der Weyden (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of incunabula, or works printed before 1500, [324] by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others. Very small woodcuts, nearly all religious, were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe from the middle of the 15th century. More expensive engravings supplied a wealthier market with a variety of images. [325]Modern perceptions [ edit]See also: Dark Ages (historiography), Medieval studies, and Middle Ages in popular culture Medieval illustration of the spherical Earth in a 14th-century copy of L'Image du monde The medieval period is frequently caricatured as a ""time of ignorance and superstition"" that placed ""the word of religious authorities over personal experience and rational activity."" [326] This is a legacy from both the Renaissance and Enlightenment, when scholars favourably contrasted their intellectual cultures with those of the medieval period. Renaissance scholars saw the Middle Ages as a period of decline from the high culture and civilisation of the Classical world; Enlightenment scholars saw reason as superior to faith, and thus viewed the Middle Ages as a time of ignorance and superstition. [14]Others argue that reason was generally held in high regard during the Middle Ages. Science historian Edward Grant writes, ""If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed [in the 18th century], they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities"". [327] Also, contrary to common belief, David Lindberg writes, ""the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the Church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led"". [328]The caricature of the period is also reflected in some more specific notions. One misconception, first propagated in the 19th century [329] and still very common, is that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat. [329] This is untrue, as lecturers in the medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere. [330] Lindberg and Ronald Numbers, another scholar of the period, state that there ""was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference"". [331] Other misconceptions such as ""the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages"", ""the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science"", or ""the medieval Christian Church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy"", are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth, although they are not supported by current historical research. [332]Notes [ edit]^ This is the year the last Western Roman Emperors were driven from Italy. [12]^ A reference work published in 1883 equates the Dark Ages with the Middle Ages, but beginning with William Paton Ker in 1904, the term ""Dark Ages"" is generally restricted to the early part of the Medieval period. For example, the 1911 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica defines the Dark Ages this way. See Dark Ages for a more complete historiography of this term.^ This system, which eventually encompassed two senior co-emperors and two junior co-emperors, is known as the Tetrarchy. [23]^ The commanders of the Roman military in the area appear to have taken food and other supplies intended to be given to the Goths and instead sold them to the Goths. The revolt was triggered when one of the Roman military commanders attempted to take the Gothic leaders hostage but failed to secure all of them. [30]^ An alternative date of 480 is sometimes given, as that was the year Romulus Augustulus' predecessor Julius Nepos died; Nepos had continued to assert that he was the Western emperor while holding onto Dalmatia. [12]^ The English word ""slave"" derives from the Latin term for Slavs, slavicus. [49]^ Brittany takes its name from this settlement by Britons. [53]^ Such entourages are named comitatus by historians, although it is not a contemporary term. It was adapted in the 19th century from a word used by the 2nd-century historian Tacitus to describe the close companions of a lord or king. [67] The comitatus comprised young men who were supposed to be utterly devoted to their lord. If their sworn lord died, they were expected to fight to the death also. [68]^ Dhu Nuwas, ruler of present-day Yemen, converted in 525 and his subsequent persecution of Christians led to the invasion and conquest of his kingdom by the Axumites of Ethiopia. [78]^ Muslim armies had earlier conquered the Visigothic kingdom of Spain, after defeating the last Visigothic King Ruderic (d. 711 or 712) at the Battle of Guadalete in 711, finishing the conquest by 719. [97]^ The Papal States endured until 1870, when the Kingdom of Italy seized most of them. [102]^ The Carolingian minuscule was developed from the uncial script of Late Antiquity, which was a smaller, rounder form of writing the Latin alphabet than the classical forms. [107]^ There was a brief re-uniting of the Empire by Charles III, known as ""the Fat"", in 884, although the actual units of the empire were not merged and retained their separate administrations. Charles was deposed in 887 and died in January 888. [112]^ The Carolingian dynasty had earlier been displaced by King Odo (r. 888–898), previously Count of Paris, who took the throne in 888. [113] Although members of the Carolingian dynasty became kings in the western lands after Odo's death, Odo's family also supplied kings—his brother Robert I became king for 922–923, and then Robert's son-in-law Raoul was king from 929 to 936—before the Carolingians reclaimed the throne once more. [114]^ Hugh Capet was a grandson of Robert I, an earlier king. [114]^ This settlement eventually expanded and sent out conquering expeditions to England, Sicily, and southern Italy. [117]^ This inheritance pattern is known as primogeniture. [162]^ Heavy cavalry had been introduced into Europe from the Persian cataphract of the 5th and 6th centuries, but the addition of the stirrup in the 7th allowed the full force of horse and rider to be used in combat. [163]^ In France, Germany, and the Low Countries there was a further type of ""noble"", the ministerialis, who were in effect unfree knights. They descended from serfs who had served as warriors or government officials, which increased status allowed their descendants to hold fiefs as well as become knights while still being technically serfs. [165]^ A few Jewish peasants remained on the land under Byzantine rule in the East as well as some on Crete under Venetian rule, but they were the exception in Europe. [171]^ These two groups—Germans and Italians—took different approaches to their trading arrangements. Most German cities co-operated in the Hanseatic League, in contrast with the Italian city-states who engaged in internecine strife. [175]^ This grouping of lands is often called the Angevin Empire. [195]^ Eleanor had previously been married to Louis VII of France (r. 1137–80), but their marriage was annulled in 1152. [196]^ Louis was canonised in 1297 by Pope Boniface VIII. [200]^ Military religious orders such as the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller were formed and went on to play an integral role in the crusader states. [212]^ It had spread to Northern Europe by 1000, and had reached Poland by the 12th century. [230]^ Crossbows are slow to reload, which limits their use on open battlefields. In sieges the slowness is not as big a disadvantage, as the crossbowman can hide behind fortifications while reloading. [235]^ The historical consensus for the last 100 years has been that the Black Death was a form of bubonic plague, but some historians have begun to challenge this view in recent years. [262]^ One town, Lübeck in Germany, lost 90 per cent of its population to the Black Death. [263]^ As happened with the Bardi and Peruzzi firms in the 1340s when King Edward III of England repudiated their loans to him. [271]^ Edward's nickname probably came from his black armour, and was first used by John Leland in the 1530s or 1540s. [278]^ Calais remained in English hands until 1558. [279]^ The word ""dunce"" derives from Duns Scotus' name. [303]^ This wheel was still simple, as it did not yet incorporate a treadle-wheel to twist and pull the fibres. That refinement was not invented until the 15th century.

D687756	http://utminers.utep.edu/omwilliamson/engl1311/fallacies.htm	.	"The A Priori Argument ( also, Rationalization; Dogmatism, Proof Texting. ): A corrupt argument from logos, starting with a given, pre-set belief, dogma, doctrine, scripture verse, ""fact"" or conclusion and then searching for any reasonable or reasonable-sounding argument to rationalize, defend or justify it. Certain ideologues and religious fundamentalists are proud to use this fallacy as their primary method of ""reasoning"" and some are even honest enough to say so. E.g., since we know there is no such thing as ""evolution,"" a prime duty of believers is to look for ways to explain away growing evidence, such as is found in DNA, that might suggest otherwise. See also the Argument from Ignorance. The opposite of this fallacy is the Taboo. Ableism (also, The Con Artist's Fallacy; The Dacoit's Fallacy; Shearing the Sheeple; Profiteering; ""Vulture Capitalism,"" ""Wealth is disease, and I am the cure. ""): A corrupt argument from ethos, arguing that because someone is intellectually slower, physically or emotionally less capable, less ambitious, less aggressive, older or less healthy (or simply more trusting or less lucky) than others, s/he ""naturally"" deserves less in life and may be freely victimized by those who are luckier, quicker, younger, stronger, healthier, greedier, more powerful, less moral or more gifted (or who simply have more immediate felt need for money, often involving some form of addiction). This fallacy is a ""softer"" argumentum ad baculum. When challenged, those who practice this fallacy seem to most often shrug their shoulders and mumble ""Life is ruff and you gotta be tuff [ sic ],"" ""You gotta do what you gotta do to get ahead in this world,"" ""It's no skin off my nose,"" ""That's free enterprise,"" ""That's the way life is!"" or similar. Actions have Consequences: The contemporary fallacy of a person in power falsely describing an imposed punishment or penalty as a ""consequence"" of another's negative act. E.g.,"" The consequences of your misbehavior could include suspension or expulsion."" A corrupt argument from ethos, arrogating to oneself or to one's rules or laws an ethos of cosmic inevitability, i.e., the ethos of God, Fate, Karma, Destiny or Reality Itself. Illness or food poisoning are likely ""consequences"" of eating spoiled food, while being ""grounded"" is a punishment for, not a ""consequence,"" of childhood misbehavior. Freezing to death is a natural ""consequence"" of going out naked in subzero weather but going to prison is a punishment for bank robbery, not a natural, inevitable or unavoidable ""consequence,"" of robbing a bank. Not to be confused with the Argument from Consequences, which is quite different. See also Blaming the Victim. An opposite fallacy is that of Moral Licensing. The Ad Hominem Argument (also, ""Personal attack,"" ""Poisoning the well""): The fallacy of attempting to refute an argument by attacking the opposition’s intelligence, morals, education, professional qualifications, personal character or reputation, using a corrupted negative argument from ethos. E.g., ""That so-called judge;"" or ""He's so evil that you can't believe anything he says."" See also ""Guilt by Association."" The opposite of this is the ""Star Power"" fallacy. Another obverse of Ad Hominem is the Token Endorsement Fallacy, where, in the words of scholar Lara Bhasin, ""Individual A has been accused of anti-Semitism, but Individual B is Jewish and says Individual A is not anti-Semitic, and the implication of course is that we can believe Individual B because, being Jewish, he has special knowledge of anti- Semitism. Or, a presidential candidate is accused of anti-Muslim bigotry, but someone finds a testimony from a Muslim who voted for said candidate, and this is trotted out as evidence against the candidate's bigotry."" The same fallacy would apply to a sports team offensively named after a marginalized ethnic group, but which has obtained the endorsement (freely given or paid) of some member, traditional leader or tribal council of that marginalized group so that the otherwise-offensive team name and logo magically become ""okay"" and nonracist. The Affective Fallacy ( also The Romantic Fallacy; Emotion over Reflection; ""Follow Your Heart""): An extremely common modern fallacy of Pathos, that one's emotions, urges or ""feelings"" are innate and in every case self-validating, autonomous, and above any human intent or act of will (one's own or others'), and are thus immune to challenge or criticism. (In fact, researchers now [2017] have robust scientific evidence that emotions are actually cognitive and not innate.) In this fallacy one argues, ""I feel it, so it must be true. My feelings are valid, so you have no right to criticize what I say or do, or how I say or do it."" This latter is also a fallacy of stasis, confusing a respectful and reasoned response or refutation with personal invalidation, disrespect, prejudice, bigotry, sexism, homophobia or hostility. A grossly sexist form of the Affective Fallacy is the well-known crude fallacy that the phallus ""Has no conscience"" (also, ""A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do;"" ""Thinking with your other head. ""), i.e., since (male) sexuality is self-validating and beyond voluntary control what one does with it cannot be controlled either and such actions are not open to criticism, an assertion eagerly embraced and extended beyond the male gender in certain reifications of ""Desire"" in contemporary academic theory. See also, Playing on Emotion. Opposite to this fallacy is the Chosen Emotion Fallacy (thanks to scholar Marc Lawson for identifying this fallacy), in which one falsely claims complete, or at least reliable prior voluntary control over one's own autonomic, ""gut level"" affective reactions. Closely related if not identical to this last is the ancient fallacy of Angelism, falsely claiming that one is capable of ""objective"" reasoning and judgment without emotion, claiming for oneself a viewpoint of Olympian ""disinterested objectivity"" or pretending to place oneself far above all personal feelings, temptations or bias. See also, Mortification. Alphabet Soup: A corrupt modern implicit fallacy from ethos in which a person inappropriately overuses acronyms, abbreviations, form numbers and arcane insider ""shop talk"" primarily to prove to an audience that s/he ""speaks their language"" and is ""one of them"" and to shut out, confuse or impress outsiders. E.g., ""It's not uncommon for a K-12 with ASD to be both GT and LD;"" ""I had a twenty-minute DX Q-so on 15 with a Zed-S1 and a couple of LU2's even though the QR-Nancy was 10 over S9;"" or ""I hope I'll keep on seeing my BAQ on my LES until the day I get my DD214."" See also, Name Calling. This fallacy has recently become common in media pharmaceutical advertising in the United States, where ""Alphabet Soup"" is used to create false identification with and to exploit patient groups suffering from specific illnesses or conditions, e.g., ""If you have DPC with associated ZL you can keep your B2D under control with Luglugmena ®. Ask your doctor today about Luglugmena ® Helium Tetracarbide lozenges to control symptoms of ZL and to keep your B2D under that crucial 7.62 threshold. Side effects of Luglugmena ® may include K4 Syndrome which may lead to lycanthropic bicephaly, BMJ and occasionally, death. Do not take Luglugmena ®if you are allergic to dogbite or have type D Flinder's Garbosis...""Alternative Truth (also, Alt Facts; Counterknowledge; Disinformation; Information Pollution): A newly-famous contemporary fallacy of logos rooted in postmodernism, denying the resilience of facts or truth as such. Writer Hannah Arendt, in her The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951) warned that ""The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the dedicated communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction, true and false, no longer exists."" Journalist Leslie Grass (2017) writes in her Blog Reachoutrecovery.com, ""Is there someone in your life who insists things happened that didn’t happen, or has a completely different version of events in which you have the facts? It’s a form of mind control and is very common among families dealing with substance and behavior problems."" She suggests that such ""Alternate Facts"" work to ""put you off balance,"" ""control the story,"" and ""make you think you're crazy,"" and she notes that ""presenting alternate facts is the hallmark of untrustworthy people."" The Alternative Truth fallacy is related to the Big Lie Technique. See also Gaslighting, Blind Loyalty, The Big Brain/Little Brain Fallacy, and Two Truths The Appeal to Closure: The contemporary fallacy that an argument, standpoint, action or conclusion no matter how questionable must be accepted as final or else the point will remain unsettled, which is unthinkable because those affected will be denied ""closure."" This fallacy falsely reifies a specialized term (closure) from Gestalt Psychology while refusing to recognize the undeniable truth that some points will indeed remain open and unsettled, perhaps forever. E.g., ""Society would be protected, real punishment would be inflicted, crime would be deterred and justice served if we sentenced you to life without parole, but we need to execute you in order to provide some closure."" See also, Argument from Ignorance, and Argument from Consequences. The opposite of this fallacy is the Paralysis of Analysis. The Appeal to Heaven: (also, Argumentum ad Coelum, Deus Vult, Gott mit Uns, Manifest Destiny, American Exceptionalism, or the Special Covenant): An ancient, extremely dangerous fallacy (a deluded argument from ethos) that of claiming to know the mind of God (or History, or a higher power), who has allegedly ordered or anointed, supports or approves of one's own country, standpoint or actions so no further justification is required and no serious challenge is possible. (E.g., ""God ordered me to kill my children,"" or ""We need to take away your land, since God [or Scripture, or Manifest Destiny, or Fate, or Heaven] has given it to us as our own."") A private individual who seriously asserts this fallacy risks ending up in a psychiatric ward, but groups or nations who do it are far too often taken seriously. Practiced by those who will not or cannot tell God's will from their own, this vicious (and blasphemous) fallacy has been the cause of endless bloodshed over history. See also, Moral Superiority, and Magical Thinking. Also applies to deluded negative Appeals to Heaven, e.g., ""You say that famine and ecological collapse due to climate change are real dangers during the coming century, but I know God wouldn't ever let that happen to us!"" The opposite of the Appeal to Heaven is the Job's Comforter fallacy. The Appeal to Nature (also, Biologizing; The Green Fallacy): The contemporary romantic fallacy of ethos (that of ""Mother Nature"") that if something is ""natural"" it has to be good, healthy and beneficial. E.g., ""Our premium herb tea is lovingly brewed from the finest freshly-picked and delicately dried natural T. Radicans leaves. Those who dismiss it as mere 'Poison Ivy' don't understand that it's 100% organic, with no additives, GMO's or artificial ingredients It's time to Go Green and lay back in Mother's arms."" One who employs or falls for this fallacy forgets the old truism that left to itself, nature is indeed ""red in tooth and claw."" This fallacy also applies to arguments alleging that something is ""unnatural,"" or ""against nature"" and thus evil ( The Argument from Natural Law) e.g. ""Homosexuality should be outlawed because it's against nature,"" arrogating to oneself the authority to define what is ""natural"" and what is unnatural or perverted. E.g., during the American Revolution British sources widely condemned rebellion against King George III as ""unnatural,"" and American revolutionaries as ""perverts,"" because the Divine Right of Kings represented Natural Law, and according to 1 Samuel 15:23 in the Bible, rebellion is like unto witchcraft. The Appeal to Pity: (also, ""Argumentum ad Miserecordiam""): The fallacy of urging an audience to “root for the underdog” regardless of the issues at hand. A classic example is, “Those poor, cute little squeaky mice are being gobbled up by mean, nasty cats ten times their size!” A contemporary example might be America's uncritical popular support for the Arab Spring movement of 2010-2012 in which The People (""The underdogs"") were seen to be heroically overthrowing cruel dictatorships, a movement that has resulted in retrospect in chaos, impoverishment, anarchy, mass suffering, civil war, the regional collapse of civilization and rise of extremism, and the largest refugee crisis since World War II. A corrupt argument from pathos. See also, Playing to Emotions. The opposite of the Appeal to Pity is the Appeal to Rigor, an argument (often based on machismo or on manipulating an audience's fear) based on mercilessness. E.g., ""I'm a real man, not like those bleeding hearts, and I'll be tough on [fill in the name of the enemy or bogeyman of the hour]."" In academia this latter fallacy applies to politically-motivated or elitist calls for ""Academic Rigor,"" and rage against university developmental / remedial classes, open admissions, ""dumbing down"" and ""grade inflation. ""The Appeal to Tradition: (also, Conservative Bias; Back in Those Good Times, ""The Good Old Days""): The ancient fallacy that a standpoint, situation or action is right, proper and correct simply because it has ""always"" been that way, because people have ""always"" thought that way, or because it was that way long ago (most often meaning in the audience members' youth or childhood, not before) and still continues to serve one particular group very well. A corrupted argument from ethos (that of past generations). E.g., ""In America, women have always been paid less, so let's not mess with long-standing tradition."" See also Argument from Inertia, and Default Bias. The opposite of this fallacy is The Appeal to Novelty (also, ""Pro-Innovation bias,"" ""Recency Bias,"" and ""The Bad Old Days;"" The Early Adopter's Fallacy), e.g., ""It's NEW, and [therefore it must be] improved!"" or ""This is the very latest discovery--it has to be better. ""Appeasement (also, ""Assertiveness,"" ""The squeaky wheel gets the grease;"" ""I know my rights! ""): This fallacy, most often popularly connected to the shameful pre-World War II appeasement of Hitler, is in fact still commonly practiced in public agencies, education and retail business today, e.g. ""Customers are always right, even when they're wrong. Don't argue with them, just give'em what they want so they'll shut up and go away, and not make a stink--it's cheaper and easier than a lawsuit."" Widespread unchallenged acceptance of this fallacy encourages offensive, uncivil public behavior and sometimes the development of a coarse subculture of obnoxious, ""assertive"" manipulators who, like ""spoiled"" children, leverage their knowledge of how to figuratively (or sometimes even literally!) ""make a stink"" into a primary coping skill in order to get what they want when they want it. The works of the late Community Organizing guru Saul Alinsky suggest practical, nonviolent ways for groups to harness the power of this fallacy to promote social change, for good or for evil.. See also Bribery. The Argument from Consequences (also, Outcome Bias): The major fallacy of logos, arguing that something cannot be true because if it were the consequences or outcome would be unacceptable. (E.g., ""Global climate change cannot be caused by human burning of fossil fuels, because if it were, switching to non-polluting energy sources would bankrupt American industry,"" or ""Doctor, that's wrong! I can't have terminal cancer, because if I did that'd mean that I won't live to see my kids get married!"") Not to be confused with Actions have Consequences. The Argument from Ignorance (also, Argumentum ad Ignorantiam): The fallacy that since we don’t know (or can never know, or cannot prove) whether a claim is true or false, it must be false, or it must be true. E.g., “Scientists are never going to be able to positively prove their crazy theory that humans evolved from other creatures, because we weren't there to see it! So, that proves the Genesis six-day creation account is literally true as written!” This fallacy includes Attacking the Evidence (also, ""Whataboutism""; The Missing Link fallacy), e.g. ""Some or all of your key evidence is missing, incomplete, or even faked! What about that? That proves you're wrong and I'm right!"" This fallacy usually includes fallacious “Either-Or Reasoning” as well: E.g., “The vet can't find any reasonable explanation for why my dog died. See! See! That proves that you poisoned him! There’s no other logical explanation!” A corrupted argument from logos, and a fallacy commonly found in American political, judicial and forensic reasoning. The recently famous ""Flying Spaghetti Monster"" meme is a contemporary refutation of this fallacy--simply because we cannot conclusively disprove the existence of such an absurd entity does not argue for its existence. See also A Priori Argument, Appeal to Closure, The Simpleton's Fallacy, and Argumentum ex Silentio. The Argument from Incredulity: The popular fallacy of doubting or rejecting a novel claim or argument out of hand simply because it appears superficially ""incredible,"" ""insane"" or ""crazy,"" or because it goes against one's own personal beliefs, prior experience or ideology. This cynical fallacy falsely elevates the saying popularized by Carl Sagan, that ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof,"" to an absolute law of logic. See also Hoyle's Fallacy. The common, popular-level form of this fallacy is dismissing surprising, extraordinary or unfamiliar arguments and evidence with a wave of the hand, a shake of the head, and a mutter of ""that's crazy! ""The Argument from Inertia (also “Stay the Course”): The fallacy that it is necessary to continue on a mistaken course of action regardless of pain and sacrifice involved and even after discovering it is mistaken, because changing course would mean admitting that one's decision (or one's leader, or one's country, or one's faith) was wrong, and all one's effort, expense, sacrifice and even bloodshed was for nothing, and that's unthinkable. A variety of the Argument from Consequences, E for Effort, or the Appeal to Tradition. See also ""Throwing Good Money After Bad. ""The Argument from Motives (also Questioning Motives): The fallacy of declaring a standpoint or argument invalid solely because of the evil, corrupt or questionable motives of the one making the claim. E.g., ""Bin Laden wanted us to withdraw from Afghanistan, so we have to keep up the fight!"" Even evil people with the most corrupt motives sometimes say the truth (and even good people with the highest and purest motives are often wrong or mistaken). A variety of the Ad Hominem argument. The opposite side of this fallacy is falsely justifying or excusing evil or vicious actions because of the perpetrator's aparent purity of motives or lack of malice. (E.g., ""Sure, she may have beaten her children bloody now and again but she was a highly educated, ambitious professional woman at the end of her rope, deprived of adult conversation and stuck between four walls for years on end with a bunch of screaming, fighting brats, doing the best she could with what little she had. How can you stand there and accuse her of child abuse?"") See also Moral Licensing. Argumentum ad Baculum (""Argument from the Club."" Also, ""Argumentum ad Baculam,"" ""Argument from Strength,"" ""Muscular Leadership,"" ""Non-negotiable Demands,"" ""Hard Power,"" Bullying, The Power-Play, Fascism, Resolution by Force of Arms, Shock and Awe. ): The fallacy of ""persuasion"" or ""proving one is right"" by force, violence, brutality, terrorism, superior strength, raw military might, or threats of violence. E.g., ""Gimmee your wallet or I'll knock your head off!"" or ""We have the perfect right to take your land, since we have the big guns and you don't."" Also applies to indirect forms of threat. E.g., ""Give up your foolish pride, kneel down and accept our religion today if you don't want to burn in hell forever and ever!"" A mainly discursive Argumentum ad Baculum is that of forcibly silencing opponents, ruling them ""out of order,"" blocking, censoring or jamming their message, or simply speaking over them or/speaking more loudly than they do, this last a tactic particularly attributed to men in mixed-gender discussions. Argumentum ad Mysteriam (""Argument from Mystery;"" also Mystagogy. ): A darkened chamber, incense, chanting or drumming, bowing and kneeling, special robes or headgear, holy rituals and massed voices reciting sacred mysteries in an unknown tongue have a quasi-hypnotic effect and can often persuade more strongly than any logical argument. The Puritan Reformation was in large part a rejection of this fallacy. When used knowingly and deliberately this fallacy is particularly vicious and accounts for some of the fearsome persuasive power of cults. An example of an Argumentum ad Mysteriam is the "" Long Ago and Far Away "" fallacy, the fact that facts, evidence, practices or arguments from ancient times, distant lands and/or ""exotic"" cultures seem to acquire a special gravitas or ethos simply because of their antiquity, language or origin, e.g., publicly chanting Holy Scriptures in their original (most often incomprehensible) ancient languages, preferring the Greek, Latin, Assyrian or Old Slavonic Christian Liturgies over their vernacular versions, or using classic or newly invented Greek and Latin names for fallacies in order to support their validity. See also, Esoteric Knowledge. An obverse of the Argumentum ad Mysteriam is the Standard Version Fallacy. Argumentum ex Silentio (Argument from Silence): The fallacy that if available sources remain silent or current knowledge and evidence can prove nothing about a given subject or question this fact in itself proves the truth of one's claim. E.g., ""Science can tell us nothing about God. That proves God doesn't exist."" Or ""Science admits it can tell us nothing about God, so you can't deny that God exists!"" Often misused in the American justice system, where, contrary to the 5th Amendment and the legal presumption of innocence until proven guilty, remaining silent or ""taking the Fifth"" is often falsely portrayed as proof of guilt. E.g., ""Mr. Hixon can offer no alibi for his whereabouts the evening of January 15th. This proves that he was in fact in room 331 at the Smuggler's Inn, murdering his wife with a hatchet!"" In today's America, choosing to remain silent in the face of a police officer's questions can make one guilty enough to be arrested or even shot. See also, Argument from Ignorance. Availability Bias (also, Attention Bias, Anchoring Bias): A fallacy of logos stemming from the natural tendency to give undue attention and importance to information that is immediately available at hand, particularly the first or last information received, and to minimize or ignore broader data or wider evidence that clearly exists but is not as easily remembered or accessed. E.g., ""We know from experience that this doesn't work,"" when ""experience"" means the most recent local attempt, ignoring overwhelming experience from other places and times where it ha s worked and does work. Also related is the fallacy of Hyperbole [also, Magnification, or sometimes Catastrophizing] where an immediate instance is immediately proclaimed ""the most significant in all of human history,"" or the ""worst in the whole world!"" This latter fallacy works extremely well with less-educated audiences and those whose ""whole world"" is very small indeed, audiences who ""hate history"" and whose historical memory spans several weeks at best. The Bandwagon Fallacy (also, Argument from Common Sense, Argumentum ad Populum): The fallacy of arguing that because ""everyone,"" ""the people,"" or ""the majority"" (or someone in power who has widespread backing) supposedly thinks or does something, it must therefore be true and right. E.g., ""Whether there actually is large scale voter fraud in America or not, many people now think there is and that makes it so."" Sometimes also includes Lying with Statistics, e.g. “Over 75% of Americans believe that crooked Bob Hodiak is a thief, a liar and a pervert. There may not be any evidence, but for anyone with half a brain that conclusively proves that Crooked Bob should go to jail! Lock him up! Lock him up!” This is sometimes combined with the ""Argumentum ad Baculum,"" e.g., ""Like it or not, it's time to choose sides: Are you going to get on board the bandwagon with everyone else, or get crushed under the wheels as it goes by?"" Or in the 2017 words of former White House spokesperson Sean Spicer, """"They should either get with the program or they can go,"" A contemporary digital form of the Bandwagon Fallacy is the Information Cascade, "" in which people echo the opinions of others, usually online, even when their own opinions or exposure to information contradicts that opinion. When information cascades form a pattern, this pattern can begin to overpower later opinions by making it seem as if a consensus already exists."" (Thanks to Teaching Tolerance for this definition!) See also Wisdom of the Crowd, and The Big Lie Technique. For the opposite of this fallacy see the Romantic Rebel fallacy. The Big Brain/Little Brain Fallacy (also, the Führerprinzip; Mad Leader Disease): A not-uncommon but extreme example of the Blind Loyalty Fallacy below, in which a tyrannical boss, military commander, or religious or cult-leader tells followers ""Don't think with your little brains (the brain in your head), but with your BIG brain (mine)."" This last is sometimes expressed in positive terms, i.e., ""You don't have to worry and stress out about the rightness or wrongness of what you are doing since I, the Leader. am assuming all moral and legal responsibility for all your actions. So long as you are faithfully following orders without question I will defend you and gladly accept all the consequences up to and including eternal damnation if I'm wrong."" The opposite of this is the fallacy of ""Plausible Deniability."" See also, ""Just Do It! "", and ""Gaslighting. ""The Big ""But"" Fallacy (also, Special Pleading): The fallacy of enunciating a generally-accepted principle and then directly negating it with a ""but."" Often this takes the form of the ""Special Case,"" which is supposedly exempt from the usual rules of law, logic, morality, ethics or even credibility E.g., ""As Americans we have always believed on principle that every human being has God-given, inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, including in the case of criminal accusations a fair and speedy trial before a jury of one's peers. BUT, your crime was so unspeakable and a trial would be so problematic for national security that it justifies locking you up for life in Guantanamo without trial, conviction or possibility of appeal."" Or, ""Yes, Honey, I still love you more than life itself, and I know that in my wedding vows I promised before God that I'd forsake all others and be faithful to you 'until death do us part,' but you have to understand, this was a special case..."" See also, ""Shopping Hungry,"" and ""We Have to do Something ! ""The Big Lie Technique (also the Bold Faced Lie; ""Staying on Message. ""): The contemporary fallacy of repeating a lie, fallacy, slogan, talking-point, nonsense-statement or deceptive half-truth over and over in different forms (particularly in the media) until it becomes part of daily discourse and people accept it without further proof or evidence. Sometimes the bolder and more outlandish the Big Lie becomes the more credible it seems to a willing, most often angry audience. E.g., ""What about the Jewish Problem?"" Note that when this particular phony debate was going on there was no ""Jewish Problem,"" only a Nazi Problem, but hardly anybody in power recognized or wanted to talk about that, while far too many ordinary Germans were only too ready to find a convenient scapegoat to blame for their suffering during the Great Depression. Writer Miles J. Brewer expertly demolishes The Big Lie Technique in his classic (1930) short story, ""The Gostak and the Doshes."" However, more contemporary examples of the Big Lie fallacy might be the completely fictitious August 4, 1964 ""Tonkin Gulf Incident"" concocted under Lyndon Johnson as a false justification for escalating the Vietnam War, or the non-existent ""Weapons of Mass Destruction"" in Iraq (conveniently abbreviated ""WMD's"" in order to lend this Big Lie a legitimizing, military-sounding ""Alphabet Soup"" ethos), used in 2003 as a false justification for the Second Gulf War. The November, 2016 U. S. President-elect's statement that ""millions"" of ineligible votes were cast in that year's American. presidential election appears to be a classic Big Lie. See also, Alternative Truth; The Bandwagon Fallacy, the Straw Man, Alphabet Soup, and Propaganda. Blind Loyalty (also Blind Obedience, Unthinking Obedience, the ""Team Player"" appeal, the Nuremberg Defense): The dangerous fallacy that an argument or action is right simply and solely because a respected leader or source (a President, expert, one’s parents, one's own ""side,"" team or country, one’s boss or commanding officers) says it is right. This is over-reliance on authority, a gravely corrupted argument from ethos that puts loyalty above truth, above one's own reason and above conscience. In this case a person attempts to justify incorrect, stupid or criminal behavior by whining ""That's what I was told to do,"" or “I was just following orders."" See also, The Big Brain/Little Brain Fallacy, and The ""Soldiers' Honor"" Fallacy. Blood is Thicker than Water (also Favoritism; Compadrismo; ""For my friends, anything. ""): The reverse of the ""Ad Hominem"" fallacy, a corrupt argument from ethos where a statement, argument or action is automatically regarded as true, correct and above challenge because one is related to, knows and likes, or is on the same team or side, or belongs to the same religion, party, club or fraternity as the individual involved. (E.g., ""My brother-in-law says he saw you goofing off on the job. You're a hard worker but who am I going to believe, you or him? You're fired!"") See also the Identity Fallacy. Brainwashing (also, Propaganda, ""Radicalization. ""): The Cold War-era fantasy that an enemy can instantly win over or ""radicalize"" an unsuspecting audience with their vile but somehow unspeakably persuasive ""propaganda,"" e.g., ""Don't look at that website! They're trying to brainwash you with their propaganda!"" Historically, ""brainwashing"" refers more properly to the inhuman Argumentum ad Baculum of ""beating an argument into"" a prisoner via a combination of pain, fear, sensory or sleep deprivation, prolonged abuse and sophisticated psychological manipulation (also, the "" Stockholm Syndrome .""). Such ""brainwashing"" can also be accomplished by pleasure ("" Love Bombing ,""); e.g., ""Did you like that? I know you did. Well, there's lots more where that came from when you sign on with us!"" (See also, ""Bribery."") An unspeakably sinister form of persuasion by brainwashing involves deliberately addicting a person to drugs and then providing or withholding the substance depending on the addict's compliance. Note: Only the other side brainwashes. ""We"" never brainwash. Bribery (also, Material Persuasion, Material Incentive, Financial Incentive). The fallacy of ""persuasion"" by bribery, gifts or favors is the reverse of the Argumentum ad Baculum. As is well known, someone who is persuaded by bribery rarely ""stays persuaded"" in the long term unless the bribes keep on coming in and increasing with time. See also Appeasement. Calling ""Cards"": A contemporary fallacy of logos, arbitrarily and falsely dismissing familiar or easily-anticipated but valid, reasoned objections to one's standpoint with a wave of the hand, as mere ""cards"" in some sort of ""game"" of rhetoric, e.g. ""Don't try to play the 'Race Card' against me,"" or ""She's playing the 'Woman Card' again,"" or ""That 'Hitler Card' won't score with me in this argument."" See also, The Taboo, and Political Correctness. Circular Reasoning (also, The Vicious Circle; Catch 22, Begging the Question, C irculus in P robando ): A fallacy of logos where A is because of B, and B is because of A, e.g., ""You can't get a job without experience, and you can't get experience without a job."" Also refers to falsely arguing that something is true by repeating the same statement in different words. E.g., “The witchcraft problem is the most urgent spiritual crisis in the world today. Why? Because witches threaten our very eternal salvation.” A corrupt argument from logos. See also the ""Big Lie technique. ""The Complex Question: The contemporary fallacy of demanding a direct answer to a question that cannot be answered without first analyzing or challenging the basis of the question itself. E.g., ""Just answer me 'yes' or 'no': Did you think you could get away with plagiarism and not suffer the consequences?"" Or, ""Why did you rob that bank?"" Also applies to situations where one is forced to either accept or reject complex standpoints or propositions containing both acceptable and unacceptable parts. A corruption of the argument from logos. A counterpart of Either/Or Reasoning. Confirmation Bias: A fallacy of logos, the common tendency to notice, search out, select and share evidence that confirms one's own standpoint and beliefs, as opposed to contrary evidence. This fallacy is how ""fortune tellers"" work--If I am told I will meet a ""tall, dark stranger"" I will be on the lookout for a tall, dark stranger, and when I meet someone even marginally meeting that description I will marvel at the correctness of the ""psychic's"" prediction. In contemporary times Confirmation Bias is most often seen in the tendency of various audiences to ""curate their political environments, subsisting on one-sided information diets and [even] selecting into politically homogeneous neighborhoods"" ( Michael A. Neblo et al., 2017, Science magazine ). Confirmation Bias (also, Homophily) means that people tend to seek out and follow solely those media outlets that confirm their common ideological and cultural biases, sometimes to an degree that leads a the false (implicit or even explicit) conclusion that ""everyone"" agrees with that bias and that anyone who doesn't is ""crazy,"" ""looney,"" evil or even ""radicalized."" See also, ""Half Truth,"" and ""Defensiveness. ""Cost Bias: A fallacy of ethos (that of a product), the fact that something expensive (either in terms of money, or something that is ""hard fought"" or ""hard won"" or for which one ""paid dearly"") is generally valued more highly than something obtained free or cheaply, regardless of the item's real quality, utility or true value to the purchaser. E. g., ""Hey, I worked hard to get this car! It may be nothing but a clunker that can't make it up a steep hill, but it's mine, and to me it's better than some millionaire's limo."" Also applies to judging the quality of a consumer item (or even of its owner!) primarily by the item's brand, price, label or source, e.g., ""Hey, you there in the Jay-Mart suit! Har-har!"" or, ""Ooh, she's driving a Mercedes! ""Default Bias: (also, Normalization of Evil, ""Deal with it;"" ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it;"" Acquiescence; ""Making one's peace with the situation;"" ""Get used to it;"" ""Whatever is, is right;"" ""It is what it is;"" ""Let it be, let it be;"" ""This is the best of all possible worlds [or, the only possible world];"" ""Better the devil you know than the devil you don't. ""): The logical fallacy of automatically favoring or accepting a situation simply because it exists right now, and arguing that any other alternative is mad, unthinkable, impossible, or at least would take too much effort, expense, stress or risk to change. The opposite of this fallacy is that of Nihilism (""Tear it all down! ""), blindly rejecting what exists in favor of what could be, the adolescent fantasy of romanticizing anarchy, chaos (an ideology sometimes called political "" Chaos Theory ""), disorder, ""permanent revolution,"" or change for change's sake. Defensiveness (also, Choice-support Bias: Myside Bias): A fallacy of ethos (one's own), in which after one has taken a given decision, commitment or course of action, one automatically tends to defend that decision and to irrationally dismiss opposing options even when one's decision later on proves to be shaky or wrong. E.g., ""Yeah, I voted for Snith. Sure, he turned out to be a crook and a liar and he got us into war, but I still say that at that time he was better than the available alternatives!"" See also ""Argument from Inertia"" and ""Confirmation Bias. ""Deliberate Ignorance: (also, Closed-mindedness; ""I don't want to hear it! ""; Motivated Ignorance; Tuning Out; Hear No Evil, See No Evil, Speak No Evil [The Three Monkeys' Fallacy]): As described by author and commentator Brian Resnik on Vox.com (2017), this is the fallacy of simply choosing not to listen, ""tuning out"" or turning off any information, evidence or arguments that challenge one's beliefs, ideology, standpoint, or peace of mind, following the popular humorous dictum: ""Don't try to confuse me with the facts; my mind is made up!"" This seemingly innocuous fallacy has enabled the most vicious tyrannies and abuses over history, and continues to do so today. See also Trust your Gut, Confirmation Bias, The Third Person Effect, ""They're All Crooks,"" the Simpleton's Fallacy, and The Positive Thinking Fallacy. Diminished Responsibility: The common contemporary fallacy of applying a specialized judicial concept (that criminal punishment should be less if one's judgment was impaired) to reality in general. E.g., ""You can't count me absent on Monday--I was hung over and couldn't come to class so it's not my fault."" Or, ""Yeah, I was speeding on the freeway and killed a guy, but I was buzzed out of my mind and didn't know what I was doing so it didn't matter that much."" In reality the death does matter very much to the victim, to his family and friends and to society in general. Whether the perpetrator was high or not does not matter at all since the material results are the same. This also includes the fallacy of Panic, a very common contemporary fallacy that one's words or actions, no matter how damaging or evil, somehow don't ""count"" because ""I panicked!"" This fallacy is rooted in the confusion of ""consequences"" with ""punishment."" See also ""Venting. ""Disciplinary Blinders: A very common contemporary scholarly or professional fallacy of ethos (that of one's discipline, profession or academic field), automatically disregarding, discounting or ignoring a priori otherwise-relevant research, arguments and evidence that come from outside one's own professional discipline, discourse community or academic area of study. E.g., ""That might be relevant or not, but it's so not what we're doing in our field right now."" See also, ""Star Power"" and ""Two Truths."" An analogous fallacy is that of Denominational Blinders, arbitrarily ignoring or waving aside without serious consideration any arguments or discussion about faith, morality, ethics, spirituality, the Divine or the afterlife that come from outside one's own specific religious denomination or faith tradition. Dog-Whistle Politics: An extreme version of reductionism and sloganeering in the public sphere, a contemporary fallacy of logos and pathos in which a brief phrase or slogan of the hour, e.g., ""Abortion,"" ""The 1%,"" ""9/11,"" ""Zionism,""""Chain Migration,"" ""Islamic Terrorism,"" ""Fascism,"" ""Communism,"" ""Big government,"" ""Taco trucks! "", ""Tax and tax and spend and spend,"" ""Gun violence,"" ""Gun control,"" ""Freedom of choice,"" ""Lock 'em up,"", ""Amnesty,"" etc. is flung out as ""red meat"" or ""chum in the water"" that reflexively sends one's audience into a snapping, foaming-at-the-mouth feeding-frenzy. Any reasoned attempt to more clearly identify, deconstruct or challenge an opponent's ""dog whistle"" appeal results in puzzled confusion at best and wild, irrational fury at worst. ""Dog whistles"" differ widely in different places, moments and cultural milieux, and they change and lose or gain power so quickly that even recent historic texts sometimes become extraordinarily difficult to interpret. A common but sad instance of the fallacy of Dog Whistle Politics is that of candidate ""debaters"" of differing political shades simply blowing a succession of discursive ""dog whistles"" at their audience instead of addressing, refuting or even bothering to listen to each other's arguments, a situation resulting in contemporary (2017) allegations that the political Right and Left in America are speaking ""different languages"" when they are simply blowing different ""dog whistles."" See also, Reductionism.. The ""Draw Your Own Conclusion"" Fallacy (also the Non-argument Argument; Let the Facts Speak for Themselves). In this fallacy of logos an otherwise uninformed audience is presented with carefully selected and groomed, ""shocking facts"" and then prompted to immediately ""draw their own conclusions."" E.g., ""Crime rates are more than twice as high among middle-class Patzinaks than among any other similar population group--draw your own conclusions."" It is well known that those who are allowed to ""come to their own conclusions"" are generally much more strongly convinced than those who are given both evidence and conclusion up front. However, Dr. William Lorimer points out that ""The only rational response to the non-argument is 'So what?' i.e. 'What do you think you've proved, and why/how do you think you've proved it?'"" Closely related (if not identical) to this is the well-known ""Leading the Witness"" Fallacy, where a sham, sarcastic or biased question is asked solely in order to evoke a desired answer. The Dunning-Kruger Effect: A cognitive bias that leads people of limited skills or knowledge to mistakenly believe their abilities are greater than they actually are. (Thanks to Teaching Tolerance for this definition!) E.g., ""I know Washington was the Father of His Country and never told a lie, Pocahontas was the first Native American, Lincoln freed the slaves, Hitler murdered six million Jews, Susan B. Anthony won equal rights for women, and Martin Luther King said ""I have a dream!"" Moses parted the Red Sea, Caesar said ""Et tu, Brute?"" and the only reason America didn't win the Vietnam War hands-down like we always do was because they tied our generals' hands and the politicians cut and run. See? Why do I need to take a history course? I know everything about history! ""E"" for Effort. (also Noble Effort; I'm Trying My Best; The Lost Cause): The common contemporary fallacy of ethos that something must be right, true, valuable, or worthy of respect and honor solely because one (or someone else) has put so much sincere good-faith effort or even sacrifice and bloodshed into it. (See also Appeal to Pity; Argument from Inertia; Heroes All; or Sob Story). An extreme example of this fallacy is Waving the Bloody Shirt ( also, the ""Blood of the Martyrs"" Fallacy), the fallacy that a cause or argument, no matter how questionable or reprehensible, cannot be questioned without dishonoring the blood and sacrifice of those who died so nobly for that cause. E.g., "" Defend the patriotic gore / That flecked the streets of Baltimore.. ."" (from the official Maryland State Song). See also Cost Bias, The Soldier's Honor Fallacy, and the Argument from Inertia. Either/Or Reasoning: (also False Dilemma, All or Nothing Thinking; False Dichotomy, Black/White Fallacy, False Binary): A fallacy of logos that falsely offers only two possible options even though a broad range of possible alternatives, variations and combinations are always readily available. E.g., ""Either you are 100% Simon Straightarrow or you are as queer as a three dollar bill--it's as simple as that and there's no middle ground!"" Or, “Either you’re in with us all the way or you’re a hostile and must be destroyed! What's it gonna be?"" Or, if your performance is anything short of perfect, you consider yourself an abject failure. Also applies to falsely contrasting one option or case to another that is not really opposed, e.g., falsely opposing ""Black Lives Matter"" to ""Blue Lives Matter"" when in fact not a few police officers are themselves African American, and African Americans and police are not (or ought not to be!) natural enemies. Or, falsely posing a choice of either helping needy American veterans or helping needy foreign refugees, when in fact in today's United States there are ample resources available to easily do both should we care to do so. See also, Overgeneralization. Equivocation: The fallacy of deliberately failing to define one's terms, or knowingly and deliberately using words in a different sense than the one the audience will understand. (E.g., President Bill Clinton stating that he did not have sexual relations with ""that woman,"" meaning no sexual penetration, knowing full well that the audience will understand his statement as ""I had no sexual contact of any kind with that woman."") This is a corruption of the argument from logos, and a tactic often used in American jurisprudence. Historically, this referred to a tactic used during the Reformation-era religious wars in Europe, when people were forced to swear loyalty to one or another side and did as demanded via ""equivocation,"" i.e., ""When I solemnly swore true faith and allegiance to the King I really meant to King Jesus, King of Kings, and not to the evil usurper squatting on the throne today."" This latter form of fallacy is excessively rare today when the swearing of oaths has become effectively meaningless except as obscenity or as speech formally subject to perjury penalties in legal or judicial settings. The Eschatological Fallacy: The ancient fallacy of arguing, ""This world is coming to an end, so..."" Popularly refuted by the observation that ""Since the world is coming to an end you won't need your life savings anyhow, so why not give it all to me? ""Esoteric Knowledge (also Esoteric Wisdom; Gnosticism; Inner Truth; the Inner Sanctum; Need to Know): A fallacy from logos and ethos, that there is some knowledge reserved only for the Wise, the Holy or the Enlightened, (or those with proper Security Clearance), things that the masses cannot understand and do not deserve to know, at least not until they become wiser, more trusted or more ""spiritually advanced."" The counterpart of this fallacy is that of Obscurantism (also Obscurationism, or Willful Ignorance), that (almost always said in a basso profundo voice) ""There are some things that we mere mortals must never seek to know!"" E.g., ""Scientific experiments that violate the privacy of the marital bed and expose the deep and private mysteries of human sexual behavior to the harsh light of science are obscene, sinful and morally evil. There are some things that we as humans are simply not meant to know!"" For the opposite of this latter, see the ""Plain Truth Fallacy."" See also, Argumentum ad Mysteriam. Essentializing: A fallacy of logos that proposes a person or thing “is what it is and that’s all that it is,” and at its core will always be the way it is right now (E.g., ""All terrorists are monsters, and will still be terrorist monsters even if they live to be 100,"" or ""'The poor you will always have with you,' so any effort to eliminate poverty is pointless.""). Also refers to the fallacy of arguing that something is a certain way ""by nature,"" an empty claim that no amount of proof can refute. (E.g., ""Americans are cold and greedy by nature,"" or ""Women are naturally better cooks than men."") See also ""Default Bias."" The opposite of this is Relativizing, the typically postmodern fallacy of blithely dismissing any and all arguments against one's standpoint by shrugging one's shoulders and responding "" Whatever..., I don't feel like arguing about it;"" ""It all depends...;"" ""That's your opinion; everything's relative;"" or falsely invoking Einstein's Theory of Relativity, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, Quantum Weirdness or the Theory of Multiple Universes in order to confuse, mystify or ""refute"" an opponent. See also, ""Red Herring"" and ""Appeal to Nature. ""The Etymological Fallacy: (also, ""The Underlying Meaning""): A fallacy of logos, drawing false conclusions from the (most often long-forgotten) linguistic origins of a current word, or the alleged meanings or associations of that word in another language. E.g., ""As used in physics, electronics and electrical engineering the term 'hysteresis' is grossly sexist since it originally came from the Greek word for 'uterus' or 'womb.'"" Or, ""I refuse to eat fish! Don't you know that the French word for ""fish"" is 'poisson,' which looks just like the English word 'poison'? And doesn't that suggest something to you?"" Famously, postmodern philosopher Jacques Derrida played on this fallacy at great length in his (1968) "" Plato's Pharmacy . ""The Excluded Middle: A corrupted argument from logos that proposes that since a little of something is good, more must be better (or that if less of something is good, none at all is even better). E.g., ""If eating an apple a day is good for you, eating an all-apple diet is even better!"" or ""If a low fat diet prolongs your life, a no-fat diet should make you live forever!"" An opposite of this fallacy is that of Excluded Outliers, where one arbitrarily discards evidence, examples or results that disprove one's standpoint by simply describing them as ""Weird,"" ""Outliers,"" or ""Atypical."" See also, ""The Big 'But' Fallacy."" Also opposite is the Middle of the Road Fallacy (also, Falacia ad Temperantiam; ""The Politics of the Center;"" Marginalization of the Adversary), where one demonstrates the ""reasonableness"" of one's own standpoint (no matter how extreme) not on its own merits, but solely or mainly by presenting it as the only ""moderate"" path among two or more obviously unacceptable extreme alternatives. E.g., anti-Communist scholar Charles Roig (1979) notes that Vladimir Lenin successfully argued for Bolshevism in Russia as the only available ""moderate"" middle path between bomb-throwing Nihilist terrorists on the ultra-left and a corrupt and hated Czarist autocracy on the right. As Texas politician and humorist Jim Hightower famously declares in an undated quote, "" The middle of the road is for yellow lines and dead armadillos. ""The ""F-Bomb"" (also Cursing; Obscenity; Profanity). An adolescent fallacy of pathos, attempting to defend or strengthen one's argument with gratuitous, unrelated sexual, obscene, vulgar, crude or profane language when such language does nothing to make an argument stronger, other than perhaps to create a sense of identity with certain young male ""urban"" audiences. This fallacy also includes adding gratuitous sex scenes or ""adult"" language to an otherwise unrelated novel or movie, sometimes simply to avoid the dreaded ""G"" rating. Related to this fallacy is the Salacious Fallacy, falsely attracting attention to and thus potential agreement with one's argument by inappropriately sexualizing it, particularly connecting it to some form of sex that is perceived as deviant, perverted or prohibited (E.g., Arguing against Bill Clinton's presidential legacy by continuing to wave Monica's Blue Dress, or against Donald Trump's presidency by obsessively highlighting his past boasting about genital groping). Historically, this dangerous fallacy was deeply implicated with the crime of lynching, in which false, racist accusations against a Black or minority victim were almost always salacious in nature and the sensation involved was successfully used to whip up public emotion to a murderous pitch. See also, Red Herring. The False Analogy: The fallacy of incorrectly comparing one thing to another in order to draw a false conclusion. E.g., ""Just like an alley cat needs to prowl, a normal adult can’t be tied down to one single lover."" The opposite of this fallacy is the Sui Generis Fallacy (also, Differance), a postmodern stance that rejects the validity of analogy and of inductive reasoning altogether because any given person, place, thing or idea under consideration is ""sui generis"" i.e., different and unique, in a class unto itself. Finish the Job: The dangerous contemporary fallacy, often aimed at a lesser-educated or working class audience, that an action or standpoint (or the continuation of that action or standpoint) may not be questioned or discussed because there is ""a job to be done"" or finished, falsely assuming ""jobs"" are meaningless but never to be questioned. Sometimes those involved internalize (""buy into"") the ""job"" and make the task a part of their own ethos. (E.g., ""Ours is not to reason why / Ours is but to do or die."") Related to this is the "" Just a Job"" fallacy. (E.g., ""How can torturers stand to look at themselves in the mirror? But I guess it's OK because for them it's just a job like any other, the job that they get paid to do."") See also ""Blind Loyalty,"" ""The Soldiers' Honor Fallacy"" and the ""Argument from Inertia. ""The Free Speech Fallacy: The infantile fallacy of responding to challenges to one's statements and standpoints by whining, ""It's a free country, isn't it? I can say anything I want to!"" A contemporary case of this fallacy is the "" Safe Space,"" or ""Safe Place,"" where it is not allowed to refute, challenge or even discuss another's beliefs because that might be too uncomfortable or ""triggery"" for emotionally fragile individuals. E.g., ""All I told him was, 'Jesus loves the little children,' but then he turned around and asked me 'But what about birth defects?' That's mean. I think I'm going to cry!"" Prof. Bill Hart Davidson (2017) notes that ""Ironically, the most strident calls for 'safety' come from those who want us to issue protections for discredited ideas. Things that science doesn't support AND that have destroyed lives - things like the inherent superiority of one race over another. Those ideas wither under demands for evidence. They *are* unwelcome. But let's be clear: they are unwelcome because they have not survived the challenge of scrutiny."" Ironically, in contemporary America ""free speech"" has often become shorthand for freedom of racist, offensive or even neo-Nazi expression, ideological trends that once in power typically quash free speech. Additionally, a recent (2017) scientific study has found that, in fact, "" people think harder and produce better political arguments when their views are challenged "" and not artificially protected without challenge. The Fundamental Attribution Error (also, Self Justification): A corrupt argument from ethos, this fallacy occurs as a result of observing and comparing behavior. ""You assume that the bad behavior of others is caused by character flaws and foul dispositions while your behavior is explained by the environment. So, for example, I get up in the morning at 10 a.m. I say it is because my neighbors party until 2 in the morning (situation) but I say that the reason why you do it is that you are lazy. Interestingly, it is more common in individualistic societies where we value self volition. Collectivist societies tend to look at the environment more. (It happens there, too, but it is much less common.)"" [Thanks to scholar Joel Sax for this!] The obverse of this fallacy is Self Deprecation (also Self Debasement), where, out of either a false humility or a genuine lack of self-esteem, one deliberately puts oneself down, most often in hopes of attracting denials, gratifying compliments and praise. Gaslighting: A recently-prominent, vicious fallacy of logic, denying or invalidating a person's own knowledge and experiences by deliberately twisting or distorting known facts, memories, scenes, events and evidence in order to disorient a vulnerable opponent and to make him or her doubt his/her sanity. E.g., ""Who are you going to believe? Me, or your own eyes?"" Or, ""You claim you found me in bed with her? Think again! You're crazy! You seriously need to see a shrink."" A very common, though cruel instance of Gaslighting that seems to have been particularly familiar among mid-20th century generations is the fallacy of Emotional Invalidation, questioning, after the fact, the reality or ""validity"" of affective states, either another's or one's own. E.g., ""Sure, I made it happen from beginning to end, but but it wasn't me doing it, it was just my stupid hormones betraying me."" Or, ""You didn't really mean it when you said you 'hate' Mommy. Now take a time-out and you'll feel better."" Or, ""No, you're not really in love; it's just infatuation or 'puppy love.'"" The fallacy of ""Gaslighting"" is named after British playwright Patrick Hamilton's 1938 stage play ""Gas Light,"" also known as ""Angel Street."" See also, Blind Loyalty, ""The Big Brain/Little Brain Fallacy,"" The Affective Fallacy, and ""Alternative Truth. ""Guilt by Association: The fallacy of trying to refute or condemn someone's standpoint, arguments or actions by evoking the negative ethos of those with whom the speaker is identified or of a group, party, religion or race to which he or she belongs or was once associated with. A form of Ad Hominem Argument, e.g., ""Don't listen to her. She's a Republican so you can't trust anything she says,"" or ""Are you or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?"" An extreme instance of this is the Machiavellian ""For my enemies, nothing"" Fallacy, where real or perceived ""enemies"" are by definition always wrong and must be conceded nothing, not even the time of day, e.g., ""He's a Republican, so even if he said the sky is blue I wouldn't believe him. ""The Half Truth (also Card Stacking, Stacking the Deck, Incomplete Information): A corrupt argument from logos, the fallacy of consciously selecting, collecting and sharing only that evidence that supports one's own standpoint, telling the strict truth but deliberately minimizing or omitting important key details in order to falsify the larger picture and support a false conclusion. (E.g. “The truth is that Bangladesh is one of the world's fastest-growing countries and can boast of a young, ambitious and hard-working population, a family-positive culture, a delightful, warm climate of tropical beaches and swaying palms where it never snows, low cost medical and dental care, a vibrant faith tradition and a multitude of places of worship, an exquisite, world-class spicy local curry cuisine and a swinging entertainment scene. Taken together, all these solid facts clearly prove that Bangladesh is one of the world’s most desirable places for young families to live, work and raise a family.”) See also, Confirmation Bias. Hero-Busting (also, ""The Perfect is the Enemy of the Good""): A postmodern fallacy of ethos under which, since nothing and nobody in this world is perfect there are not and have never been any heroes: Washington and Jefferson held slaves, Lincoln was (by our contemporary standards) a racist, Karl Marx sexually exploited his family's own young live-in domestic worker and got her pregnant, Martin Luther King Jr. had an eye for women too, Lenin condemned feminism, the Mahatma drank his own urine (ugh! ), Pope Francis is wrong on abortion, capitalism, same-sex marriage and women's ordination, Mother Teresa loved suffering and was wrong on just about everything else too, etc., etc Also applies to the now near-universal political tactic of ransacking everything an opponent has said, written or done since infancy in order to find something to misinterpret or condemn (and we all have something! ). An early example of this latter tactic is deftly described in Robert Penn Warren's classic (1946) novel, All the King's Men. This is the opposite of the ""Heroes All"" fallacy, below. The ""Hero Busting"" fallacy has also been selectively employed at the service of the Identity Fallacy (see below) to falsely ""prove"" that ""you cannot trust anyone"" but a member of ""our"" identity-group since everyone else, even the so-called ""heroes"" or ""allies"" of other groups, are all racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, or hate ""us."" E.g., In 1862 Abraham Lincoln said he was willing to settle the U. S. Civil War either with or without freeing the slaves if it would preserve the Union, thus ""conclusively proving"" that all whites are viciously racist at heart and that African Americans must do for self and never trust any of ""them,"" not even those who claim to be allies. Heroes All (also, ""Everybody's a Winner""): The contemporary fallacy that everyone is above average or extraordinary. A corrupted argument from pathos (not wanting anyone to lose or to feel bad). Thus, every member of the Armed Services, past or present, who serves honorably is a national hero, every student who competes in the Science Fair wins a ribbon or trophy, and every racer is awarded a winner's yellow jersey. This corruption of the argument from pathos, much ridiculed by disgraced American humorist Garrison Keeler, ignores the fact that if everybody wins nobody wins, and if everyone's a hero no one's a hero. The logical result of this fallacy is that, as children's author Alice Childress writes (1973), "" A hero ain't nothing but a sandwich ."" See also the ""Soldiers' Honor Fallacy. ""Hoyle's Fallacy: A fallacy of logos, falsely assuming that a possible event of low (even vanishingly low) probability can never have happened and/or would never happen in real life. E.g., ""The probability of something as complex as human DNA emerging by purely random evolution in the time the earth has existed is so negligible that it is for all practical purposes impossible and must have required divine intervention."" Or, ""The chance of a casual, Saturday-night poker player being dealt four aces off an honest, shuffled deck is so infinitesimal that it would never occur even once in a normal lifetime! That proves you cheated!"" See also, Argument from Incredulity. An obverse of Hoyle's Fallacy is ""You Can't Win if You Don't Play,"" (also, ""Someone's gonna win and it might as well be YOU!"") a common and cruel contemporary fallacy used to persuade vulnerable audiences, particularly the poor, the mathematically illiterate and gambling addicts to throw their money away on lotteries, horse races, casinos and other long-shot gambling schemes. I Wish I Had a Magic Wand: The fallacy of regretfully (and falsely) proclaiming oneself powerless to change a bad or objectionable situation over which one has power. E.g., ""What can we do about gas prices? As Secretary of Energy I wish I had a magic wand, but I don't"" [shrug] . Or, ""No, you can't quit piano lessons. I wish I had a magic wand and could teach you piano overnight, but I don't, so like it or not, you have to keep on practicing."" The parent, of course, ignores the possibility that the child may not want or need to learn piano. See also, TINA. The Identity Fallacy (also Identity Politics; ""Die away, ye old forms and logic!"" ): A corrupt postmodern argument from ethos, a variant on the Argumentum ad Hominem in which the validity of one's logic, evidence, experience or arguments depends not on their own strength but rather on whether the one arguing is a member of a given social class, generation, nationality, religious or ethnic group, color, gender or sexual orientation, profession, occupation or subgroup. In this fallacy, valid opposing evidence and arguments are brushed aside or ""othered"" without comment or consideration, as simply not worth arguing about solely because of the lack of proper background or ethos of the person making the argument, or because the one arguing does not self-identify as a member of the ""in-group."" E.g., ""You'd understand me right away if you were Burmese but since you're not there's no way I can explain it to you,"" or ""Nobody but another nurse can know what a nurse has to go through."" Identity fallacies are reinforced by common ritual, language, and discourse. However, these fallacies are occasionally self-interested, driven by the egotistical ambitions of academics, politicians and would-be group leaders anxious to build their own careers by carving out a special identity group constituency to the exclusion of existing broader-based identities and leadership. An Identity Fallacy may lead to scorn or rejection of potentially useful allies, real or prospective, because they are not of one's own identity. The Identity Fallacy promotes an exclusivist, sometimes cultish ""do for self"" philosophy which in today's world virtually guarantees self-marginalization and ultimate defeat. A recent application of the Identity Fallacy is the fallacious accusation of "" Cultural Appropriation,"" in which those who are not of the right Identity are condemned for ""appropriating"" the cuisine, clothing, language or music of a marginalized group, forgetting the old axiom that ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."" Accusations of Cultural Appropriation very often stem from competing selfish economic interests (E.g., ""What right do those p*nche Gringos have to set up a taco place right here on Guadalupe Drive to take away business from Doña Teresa's Taquería? They even dare to play Mexican music in their dining room! That's cultural appropriation!""). See also, Othering. Infotainment (also Infortainment; Fake News; Info Wars); A very corrupt and dangerous modern media-driven fallacy that deliberately and knowingly stirs in facts, news, falsities and outright lies with entertainment, a mixture usually concocted for specific, base ideological and profit-making motives. Origins of this fallacy predate the current era in the form of ""Yellow"" or ""Tabloid"" Journalism. This deadly fallacy has caused endless social unrest, discontent and even shooting wars (e.g., the Spanish American War) over the course of modern history. Practitioners of this fallacy sometimes hypocritically justify its use on the basis that their readers/listeners/viewers ""know beforehand"" (or should know) that the content offered is not intended as real news and is offered for entertainment purposes only, but in fact this caveat is rarely observed by uncritical audiences who eagerly swallow what the purveyors put forth. See also Dog-Whistle Politics. The Job's Comforter Fallacy (also, ""Karma is a bi**h;"" ""What goes around comes around. ""): The fallacy that since there is no such thing as random chance and we (I, my group, or my country) are under special protection of heaven, any misfortune or natural disaster that we suffer must be a punishment for our own or someone else's secret sin or open wickedness. The opposite of the Appeal to Heaven, this is the fallacy employed by the Westboro Baptist Church members who protest fallen service members' funerals all around the United States. See also, Magical Thinking. Just Do it. ( also, ""Find a way;"" ""I don't care how you do it;"" ""Accomplish the mission;"" ""By Any Means Necessary."" ): A pure, abusive Argumentum ad Baculum (argument from force), in which someone in power arbitrarily waves aside or overrules the moral objections of subordinates or followers and orders them to accomplish a goal by any means required, fair or foul The clear implication is that unethical or immoral methods should be used. E.g., ""You say there's no way you can finish the dig on schedule because you found an old pioneer gravesite with a fancy tombstone on the excavation site? Well, find a way! Make it disappear! Just do it! I don't want to know how you do it, just do it! This is a million dollar contract and we need it done by Tuesday."" See also, Plausible Deniability. Just Plain Folks (also, ""Values"" ): This corrupt modern argument from ethos argues to a less-educated or rural audience that the one arguing is ""just plain folks"" who is a ""plain talker,"" ""says what s/he is thinking,"" ""scorns political correctness,"" someone who ""you don't need a dictionary to understand"" and who thinks like the audience and is thus worthy of belief, unlike some member of the fancy-talking, latte-sipping Left Coast Political Elite, some ""double-domed professor,"" ""inside-the-beltway Washington bureaucrat,"" ""tree-hugger"" or other despised outsider who ""doesn't think like we do"" or ""doesn't share our values."" This is a counterpart to the Ad Hominem Fallacy and most often carries a distinct reek of xenophobia or racism as well. See also the Plain Truth Fallacy and the Simpleton's Fallacy. The Law of Unintended Consequences (also, ""Every Revolution Ends up Eating its own Young:"" Grit; Resilience Doctrine): In this very dangerous, archly pessimistic postmodern fallacy the bogus ""Law of Unintended Consequences,"" once a semi-humorous satirical corollary of ""Murphy's Law,"" is elevated to to the status of an iron law of history. This fallacy arbitrarily proclaims a priori that since we can never know everything or securely foresee anything, sooner or later in today's ""complex world"" unforeseeable adverse consequences and negative side effects (so-called ""unknown unknowns"") will always end up blindsiding and overwhelming, defeating and vitiating any and all naive ""do-gooder"" efforts to improve our world. Instead, one must always expect defeat and be ready to roll with the punches by developing ""grit"" or ""resilience"" as a primary survival skill. This nihilist fallacy is a practical negation of the the possibility of any valid argument from logos. See also, TINA. Lying with Statistics: The contemporary fallacy of misusing true figures and numbers to “prove” unrelated claims. (e.g. ""In real terms, attending college has never been cheaper than it is now. When expressed as a percentage of the national debt, the cost of getting a college education is actually far less today than it was back in 1965!""). A corrupted argument from logos, often preying on the public's perceived or actual mathematical ignorance. This includes the Tiny Percentage Fallacy, that an amount or action that is quite significant in and of itself somehow becomes insignificant simply because it's a tiny percentage of something much larger. E.g., the arbitrary arrest, detention or interception of ""only"" a few hundred legally-boarded international travelers as a tiny percentage of the tens of thousands who normally arrive. Under this same fallacy a consumer who would choke on spending an extra dollar for two cans of peas will typically ignore $50 extra on the price of a car or $1000 extra on the price of a house simply because these differences are ""only"" a tiny percentage of the much larger amount being spent. Historically, sales taxes or value-added taxes (VAT) have successfully gained public acceptance and remain ""under the radar"" because of this latter fallacy, even though amounting to hundreds or thousands of dollars a year in extra tax burden. See also Half-truth, the Snow Job, and the Red Herring. Magical Thinking (also, the Sin of Presumption; Expect a Miracle! ): An ancient but deluded fallacy of logos, arguing that when it comes to ""crunch time,"" provided one has enough faith, prays hard enough, says the right words, does the right rituals, ""names it and claims it,"" or ""claims the Promise,"" God will always suspend the laws of the universe and work a miracle at the request of or for the benefit of the True Believer. In practice this nihilist fallacy denies the existence of a rational or predictable universe and thus the possibility of any valid argument from logic. See also, Positive Thinking, the Appeal to Heaven, and the Job's Comforter fallacy. Mala Fides (Arguing in Bad Faith; also Sophism): Using an argument that the arguer himself or herself knows is not valid. E.g., An unbeliever attacking believers by throwing verses from their own Holy Scriptures at them, or a lawyer arguing for the innocence of someone whom s/he knows full well to be guilty. This latter is a common practice in American jurisprudence, and is sometimes portrayed as the worst face of ""Sophism."" [ Special thanks to Bradley Steffens for pointing out this fallacy!] Included under this fallacy is the fallacy of Motivational Truth ( also, Demagogy, or Campaign Promises), deliberately lying to ""the people"" to gain their support or motivate them toward some action the rhetor perceives to be desirable (using evil discursive means toward a ""good"" material end). A particularly bizarre and corrupt form of this latter fallacy is Self Deception (also, Whistling by the Graveyard). in which one deliberately and knowingly deludes oneself in order to achieve a goal, or perhaps simply to suppress anxiety and maintain one's energy level, enthusiasm, morale, peace of mind or sanity in moments of adversity. Measurability: A corrupt argument from logos and ethos (that of science and mathematics), the modern Fallacy of Measurability proposes that if something cannot be measured, quantified and replicated it does not exist, or is ""nothing but anecdotal, touchy-feely stuff"" unworthy of serious consideration, i.e., mere gossip or subjective opinion. Often, achieving ""Measurability"" necessarily demands preselecting, ""fiddling"" or ""massaging"" the available data simply in order to make it statistically tractable, or in order to support a desired conclusion. Scholar Thomas Persing thus describes ""The modernist fallacy of falsely and inappropriately applying norms, standardizations, and data point requirements to quantify productivity or success. This is similar to complex question, measurability, and oversimplification fallacies where the user attempts to categorize complicated / diverse topics into terms that when measured, suit their position. For example, the calculation of inflation in the United States doesn't include the changes in the price to gasoline, because the price of gasoline is too volatile, despite the fact gasoline is necessary for most people to live their lives in the United States."" See also, ""A Priori Argument,"" ""Lying with Statistics,"" and the ""Procrustean Fallacy. ""Mind-reading (Also, ""The Fallacy of Speculation;"" ""I can read you like a book""): An ancient fallacy, a corruption of stasis theory, speculating about someone else's thoughts, emotions, motivations and ""body language"" and then claiming to understand these clearly, sometimes more accurately than the person in question knows themselves. The rhetor deploys this phony ""knowledge"" as a fallacious warrant for or against a given standpoint. Scholar Myron Peto offers as an example the baseless claim that “Obama doesn’t a da** [sic] for human rights.” Assertions that ""call for speculation"" are rightly rejected as fallacious in U. S. judicial proceedings but far too often pass uncontested in public discourse. The opposite of this fallacy is the postmodern fallacy of Mind Blindness (also, the Autist's Fallacy ), a complete denial of any normal human capacity for ""Theory of Mind,"" postulating the utter incommensurability and privacy of minds and thus the impossibility of ever knowing or truly understanding another's thoughts, emotions, motivations or intents. This fallacy, much promoted by the late postmodernist guru Jacques Derrida, necessarily vitiates any form of Stasis Theory. However, the Fallacy of Mind Blindness has been decisively refuted in several studies, including recent (2017) research published by the Association for Psychological Science, and a (2017) Derxel University study indicating how ""our minds align when we communicate. ""Moral Licensing: The contemporary ethical fallacy that one's consistently moral life, good behavior or recent extreme suffering or sacrifice earns him/her the right to commit an immoral act without repercussions, consequences or punishment. E.g., ""I've been good all year, so one bad won't matter,"" or ""After what I've been through, God knows I need this."" The fallacy of Moral Licensing is also sometimes applied to nations, e.g., ""Those who criticize repression and the Gulag in the former USSR forget what extraordinary suffering the Russians went through in World War II and the millions upon millions who died."" See also Argument from Motives. The opposite of this fallacy is the (excessively rare in our times) ethical fallacy of Scruples, in which one obsesses to pathological excess about one's accidental, forgotten, unconfessed or unforgiven sins and because of them, the seemingly inevitable prospect of eternal damnation. Moral Superiority (also, Self Righteousness; the Moral High Ground): An ancient, immoral and extremely dangerous fallacy, enunciated in Thomistic / Scholastic philosophy in the late Middle Ages, arguing that Evil has no rights that the Good and the Righteous are bound to respect. That way lies torture, heretic-burning, and the Spanish Inquisition. Those who practice this vicious fallacy reject any ""moral equivalency"" (i.e., even-handed treatment) between themselves (the Righteous) and their enemies (the Wicked), against whom anything is fair, and to whom nothing must be conceded, not even the right to life. This fallacy is a specific denial of the ancient ""Golden Rule,"" and has been the cause of endless intractable conflict, since if one is Righteous no negotiation with Evil and its minions is possible; The only imaginable road to a ""just"" peace is through total victory, i.e., the absolute defeat and liquidation of one's Wicked enemies. American folk singer and Nobel Laureate Bob Dylan expertly demolishes this fallacy in his 1963 protest song, ""With God on Our Side."" See also the Appeal to Heaven, and Moving the Goalposts. Mortification (also, Live as Though You're Dying; Pleasure-hating; No Pain No Gain): An ancient fallacy of logos, trying to ""beat the flesh into submission"" by extreme exercise or ascetic practices, deliberate starvation or infliction of pain, denying the undeniable fact that discomfort and pain exist for the purpose of warning of lasting damage to the body. Extreme examples of this fallacy are various forms of self-flagellation such as practiced by the New Mexico "" Penitentes "" during Holy Week or by Shia devotees during Muharram. More familiar contemporary manifestations of this fallacy are extreme ""insanity"" exercise regimes not intended for normal health, fitness or competitive purposes but just to ""toughen"" or ""punish"" the body. Certain pop-nutritional theories and diets seem based on this fallacy as well. Some contemporary experts suggest that self-mortification (an English word related to the Latinate French root ""mort,"" or ""death."") is in fact ""suicide on the installment plan."" Others suggest that it involves a narcotic-like addiction to the body's natural endorphins. The opposite of this fallacy is the ancient fallacy of Hedonism, seeking and valuing physical pleasure as a good in itself, simply for its own sake. Moving the Goalposts (also, Changing the Rules; All's Fair in Love and War; The Nuclear Option; ""Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing""): A fallacy of logos, demanding certain proof or evidence, a certain degree of support or a certain number of votes to decide an issue, and then when this is offered, demanding even more, different or better support in order to deny victory to an opponent. For those who practice the fallacy of Moral Superiority (above), Moving the Goalposts is often perceived as perfectly good and permissible if necessary to prevent the victory of Wickedness and ensure the triumph of one's own side, i.e, the Righteous. MYOB (Mind Your Own Business; also You're Not the Boss of Me; ""None of yer beeswax,"" ""So What? "", The Appeal to Privacy): The contemporary fallacy of arbitrarily prohibiting or terminating any discussion of one's own standpoints or behavior, no matter how absurd, dangerous, evil or offensive, by drawing a phony curtain of privacy around oneself and one's actions. A corrupt argument from ethos (one's own). E.g., ""Sure, I was doing eighty and weaving between lanes on Mesa Street--what's it to you? You're not a cop, you're not my nanny. It's my business if I want to speed, and your business to get the hell out of my way. Mind your own damn business!"" Or, ""Yeah, I killed my baby. So what? Butt out! It wasn't your brat, so it's none of your damn business!"" Rational discussion is cut off because ""it is none of your business!"" See also, ""Taboo."" The counterpart of this is "" Nobody Will Ever Know, "" (also ""What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas;"" ""I Think We're Alone Now,"" or the Heart of Darkness Syndrome) the fallacy that just because nobody important is looking (or because one is on vacation, or away in college, or overseas) one may freely commit immoral, selfish, negative or evil acts at will without expecting any of the normal consequences or punishment . Author Joseph Conrad graphically describes this sort of moral degradation in the character of Kurtz in his classic novel, Heart of Darkness. Name-Calling: A variety of the ""Ad Hominem"" argument. The dangerous fallacy that, simply because of who one is or is alleged to be, any and all arguments, disagreements or objections against one's standpoint or actions are automatically racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, bigoted, discriminatory or hateful. E.g., ""My stand on abortion is the only correct one. To disagree with me, argue with me or question my judgment in any way would only show what a pig you really are."" Also applies to refuting an argument by simply calling it a ""fallacy,"" or declaring it invalid without proving why it is invalid, or summarily dismissing arguments or opponents by labeling them ""racist,"" ""communist,"" ""fascist,"" ""moron,"" any name followed by the suffix ""tard"" (short for the highly offensive ""retard"") or some other negative name without further explanation. E.g., ""He's an a**hole, end of story"" or ""I'm a loser."" A subset of this is the Newspeak fallacy, creating identification with a certain kind of audience by inventing or using racist or offensive, sometimes military-sounding nicknames for opponents or enemies, e.g., ""The damned DINO's are even worse than the Repugs and the Neocons."" Or, ""In the Big One it took us only five years to beat both the J*ps and the Jerries, so more than a decade and a half after niner-eleven why is it so hard for us to beat a raggedy bunch of Hajjis and Towel-heads?"" Note that originally the word ""Nazi"" belonged in this category, but this term has long come into use as a proper English noun. See also, ""Reductionism,"" ""Ad Hominem Argument,"" and ""Alphabet Soup. ""The Narrative Fallacy (also, the Fable; the Poster Child) The ancient fallacy of persuasion by telling a ""heartwarming"" or horrifying story or fable, particularly to less-educated or uncritical audiences who are less likely to grasp purely logical arguments or general principles. E.g., Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol."" Narratives and fables, particularly those that name names and personalize arguments, tend to be far more persuasive at a popular level than other forms of argument and are virtually irrefutable, even when the story in question is well known to be entirely fictional. This fallacy is found even in the field of science, as noted by a recent (2017) scientific study. The NIMBY Fallacy (Not in My Back Yard; also ""Build a Wall! ""; ""Lock'em up and throw away the key;"" The Ostrich Strategy; The Gitmo Solution.). The infantile fallacy that a problem, challenge or threat that is not physically nearby or to which I am not directly exposed has for all practical purposes ""gone away"" and ceased to exist. Thus, a problem can be permanently and definitively solved by ""making it go away,"" preferably to someplace ""out of sight,"" a walled-off ghetto or a distant isle where there is no news coverage, and where nobody important stays. Lacking that, it can be made to go away by simply eliminating, censoring or ignoring ""negative"" media coverage and public discussion of the problem and focusing on ""positive, encouraging"" things instead. No Discussion (also No Negotiation; the Control Voice; Peace through Strength; a Muscular Foreign Policy; Fascism): A pure Argumentum ad Baculum that rejects reasoned dialogue, offering either instant, unconditional compliance/surrender or defeat/death as the only two options for settling even minor differences, e.g., screaming ""Get down on the ground, now !"" or declaring ""We don't talk to terrorists."" This deadly fallacy falsely paints real or potential ""hostiles"" as monsters devoid of all reason, and far too often contains a very strong element of ""machismo"" as well. I.e. ""A real, muscular leader never resorts to pantywaist pleading, apologies, excuses, fancy talk or argument. That's for lawyers, liars and pansies and is nothing but a delaying tactic. A real man stands tall, says what he thinks, draws fast and shoots to kill."" The late actor John Wayne frequently portrayed this fallacy in his movie roles. See also, The Pout. Non-recognition: A deluded fallacy in which one deliberately chooses not to publicly ""recognize"" ground truth, usually on the theory that this would somehow reward evil-doers if we recognize their deeds as real or consequential. Often the underlying theory is that the situation is ""temporary"" and will soon be reversed. E.g., In the decades from 1949 until Richard Nixon's presidency the United States officially refused to recognize the existence of the most populous nation on earth, the People's Republic of China, because America supported the U. S.-friendly Republic of China government on Taiwan instead and hoped they might somehow return to power on the mainland. Perversely, in 2016 the U. S. President-Elect caused a significant international flap by chatting with the President of the government on Taiwan, a de facto violation of long-standing American non-recognition of that same regime. More than half a century after the Korean War the U. S. still refuses to pronounce the name of, or recognize (much less conduct normal, peaceful negotiations with) a nuclear-armed DPRK (North Korea). An individual who practices this fallacy risks institutionalization (e.g., ""I refuse to recognize Mom's murder, 'cuz that'd give the victory to the murderer! I refuse to watch you bury her! Stop! Stop!"") but tragically, such behavior is only too common in international relations. See also the State Actor Fallacy, Political Correctness, and The Pout. The Non Sequitur: The deluded fallacy of offering evidence, reasons or conclusions that have no logical connection to the argument at hand (e.g. “The reason I flunked your course is because the U. S. government is now putting out purple five-dollar bills! Purple! ”). (See also Red Herring. )Occasionally involves the breathtaking arrogance of claiming to have special knowledge of why God, fate, karma or the Universe is doing certain things. E.g., ""This week's earthquake was obviously meant to punish those people for their great wickedness."" See also, Magical Thinking, and the Appeal to Heaven. Nothing New Under the Sun (also, Uniformitarianism, “Seen it all before;” ""Surprise, surprise;"" ""Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose."") : Fairly rare in contemporary discourse, this deeply cynical fallacy, a corruption of the argument from logos, falsely proposes that there is not and will never be any real novelty in this world. Any argument that there are truly “new” ideas or phenomena is judged a priori to be unworthy of serious discussion and dismissed with a jaded sigh and a wave of the hand as ""the same old same old."" E.g., “ [Sigh!] Idiots! Don't you see that the current influx of refugees from the Mideast is just the same old Muslim invasion of Christendom that’s been going on for 1,400 years?” Or, “Libertarianism is nothing but re-warmed anarchism, which, in turn, is nothing but the ancient Antinomian Heresy. Like I told you before, there's nothing new under the sun!”Olfactory Rhetoric (also, ""The Nose Knows""): A vicious, zoological-level fallacy of pathos in which opponents are marginalized, dehumanized or hated primarily based on their supposed odor, lack of personal cleanliness, imagined diseases or filth. E. g., ""Those demonstrators are demanding something or another but I'll only talk to them if first they go home and take a bath!"" Or, ""I can smell a Jew a block away!"" Also applies to demeaning other cultures or nationalities based on their differing cuisines, e.g., ""I don't care what they say or do, their breath always stinks of garlic. And have you ever smelled their kitchens?"" Olfactory Rhetoric straddles the borderline between a fallacy and a psychopathology. A2017 study by Ruhr University Bochumsuggests that olfactory rhetoric does not arise from a simple, automatic physiological reaction to an actual odor, but in fact, strongly depends on one's predetermined reaction or prejudices toward another, and one's olfactory center ""is activated even before we perceive an odour."" See also, Othering. Oops! (also, ""Oh, I forgot...,"" ""The Judicial Surprise,"" ""The October Surprise,""): A corrupt argument from logos in which toward the decisive end of a discussion, debate, trial, electoral campaign period, or decision-making process an opponent suddenly, elaborately and usually sarcastically shams having just remembered or uncovered some salient fact, argument or evidence. E.g., ""Oops, I forgot to ask you: You were convicted of this same offense twice before, weren't you?!"" Banned in American judicial argument, this fallacy is only too common in public discourse. Also applies to supposedly ""discovering"" and sensationally reporting some potentially damning information or evidence and then, after the damage has been done or the decision has been made, quietly declaring, ""Oops, I guess that really wasn't that significant after all. Ignore what I said. Sorry 'bout that! ""Othering (also Otherizing, ""They're Not Like Us,"" Stereotyping, Xenophobia, Racism, Prejudice): A badly corrupted, discriminatory argument from ethos where facts, arguments, experiences or objections are arbitrarily disregarded, ignored or put down without serious consideration because those involved ""are not like us,"" or ""don't think like us."" E.g., ""It's OK for Mexicans to earn a buck an hour in the maquiladoras [Mexico-based ""Twin Plants"" run by American or other foreign corporations]. If it happened here I'd call it brutal exploitation and daylight robbery but south of the border, down Mexico way the economy is different and they're not like us."" Or, ""You claim that life must be really terrible over there for terrorists to ever think of blowing themselves up with suicide vests just to make a point, but always remember that they're different from us. They don't think about life and death the same way we do."" A vicious variety of the Ad Hominem Fallacy, most often applied to non-white or non-Christian populations. A variation on this fallacy is the ""Speakee"" Fallacy (""You speakee da English? ""; also the Shibboleth), in which an opponent's arguments are mocked, ridiculed and dismissed solely because of the speaker's alleged or real accent, dialect, or lack of fluency in standard English, e.g., ""He told me 'Vee vorkers need to form a younion!' but I told him I'm not a 'vorker,' and to come back when he learns to speak proper English."" A very dangerous, extreme example of Othering is Dehumanization, a fallacy of faulty analogy where opponents are dismissed as mere cockroaches, lice, apes, monkeys, rats, weasels or bloodsucking parasites who have no right to speak or to live at all, and probably should be ""squashed like bugs."" This fallacy is ultimately the ""logic"" behind ethnic cleansing, genocide and gas ovens. See also the Identity Fallacy, ""Name Calling"" and ""Olfactory Rhetoric."" The opposite of this fallacy is the ""Pollyanna Principle"" below. Overexplanation: A fallacy of logos stemming from the real paradox that beyond a certain point, more explanation, instructions, data, discussion, evidence or proof inevitably results in less, not more, understanding. Contemporary urban mythology holds that this fallacy is typically male ("" Mansplaining ""), while barely half a century ago the prevailing myth was that it was men who were naturally monosyllabic, grunting or non-verbal while women would typically overexplain (e.g., the 1960 hit song by Joe Jones, ""You Talk Too Much""). ""Mansplaining"" is, according to scholar Danelle Pecht, ""the infuriating tendency of many men to always have to be the smartest person in the room, regardless of the topic of discussion and how much they actually know!"" See also The Snow Job, and the ""Plain Truth"" fallacy. Overgeneralization (also Hasty Generalization; Totus pro Partes Fallacy; the Merological Fallacy ): A fallacy of logos where a broad generalization that is agreed to be true is offered as overriding all particular cases, particularly special cases requiring immediate attention. E.g., ""Doctor, you say that this time of year a flu vaccination is essential. but I would counter that ALL vaccinations are essential"" (implying that I'm not going to give special attention to getting the flu shot). Or, attempting to refute ""Black Lives Matter"" by replying, ""All Lives Matter,"" the latter undeniably true but still a fallacious overgeneralization in that specific and urgent context. "" Overgeneralization can also mean one sees a single negative outcome as an eternal pattern of defeat. Overgeneralization may also include the the Pars pro Toto Fallacy, the stupid but common fallacy of incorrectly applying one or two true examples to all cases. E.g., a minority person who commits a particularly horrifying crime, and whose example is then used to smear the reputation of the entire group, or when a government publishes special lists of crimes committed by groups who are supposed to be hated, e.g., Jews, or undocumented immigrants. Famously, the case of one Willie Horton was successfully used in this manner in the 1988 American presidential election to smear African Americans, Liberals, and by extension, Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. See also the fallacy of ""Zero Tolerance"" below. The Paralysis of Analysis (also, Procrastination; the Nirvana Fallacy): A postmodern fallacy that since all data is never in, any conclusion is always provisional, no legitimate decision can ever be made and any action should always be delayed until forced by circumstances. A corruption of the argument from logos. (See also the ""Law of Unintended Consequences. "")The Passive Voice Fallacy (also, the Bureaucratic Passive): A fallacy from ethos, concealing active human agency behind the curtain of the grammatical passive voice, e.g., ""It has been decided that you are to be let go,"" arrogating an ethos of cosmic infallibility and inevitability to a very fallible conscious decision made by identifiable, fallible and potentially culpable human beings. Scholar Jackson Katz notes (2017): ""We talk about how many women were raped last year, not about how many men raped women. We talk about how many girls in a school district were harassed last year, not about how many boys harassed girls. We talk about how many teenage girls in the state of Vermont got pregnant last year, rather than how many men and boys impregnated teenage girls. ... So you can see how the use of the passive voice has a political effect. [It] shifts the focus off of men and boys and onto girls and women. Even the term 'Violence against women' is problematic. It's a passive construction; there's no active agent in the sentence. It's a bad thing that happens to women, but when you look at the term 'violence against women' nobody is doing it to them, it just happens to them... Men aren't even a part of it."" See also, Political Correctness. An obverse of the Passive Voice Fallacy is the Be-verb Fallacy , a cultish linguistic theory and the bane of many a first-year composition student's life, alleging that an extraordinary degree of ""clarity,"" ""sanity,"" or textual ""liveliness"" can be reached by strictly eliminating all passive verb forms and all forms of the verb ""to be"" from English-language writing. This odd but unproven contention, dating back to Alfred Korzybski's ""General Semantics"" self-improvement movement of the 1920's and '30's via S. I. Hayakawa, blithely ignores the fact that although numerous major world languages lack a ubiquitous ""be-verb,"" e.g., Russian, Hindi and Arabic, speakers of these languages, like English-speaking General Semantics devotees themselves, have never been proven to enjoy any particular cognitive advantage over ordinary everyday users of the passive voice and the verb ""to be."" Nor have writers of the curiously stilted English that results from applying this fallacy achieved any special success in academia, professional or technical writing, or in the popular domain. Paternalism: A serious fallacy of ethos, arbitrarily tut-tutting, dismissing or ignoring another's arguments or concerns as ""childish"" or ""immature;"" taking a condescending attitude of superiority toward opposing standpoints or toward opponents themselves. E.g., ""Your argument against the war is so infantile. Try approaching the issue like an adult for a change,"" ""I don't argue with children ,"" or ""Somebody has to be the grownup in the room, and it might as well be me. Here's why you're wrong..."" Also refers to the sexist fallacy of dismissing a woman's argument because she is a woman, e.g., ""Oh, it must be that time of the month, eh?"" See also ""Ad Hominem Argument"" and ""Tone Policing. ""Personalizaion: A deluded fallacy of ethos, seeing yourself or someone else as the essential cause of some external event for which you or the other person had no responsibility. E.g., ""Never fails! It had to happen! It's my usual rotten luck that the biggest blizzard of the year had to occur just on the day of our winter festival. If it wasn't for ME being involved I'm sure the blizzard wouldn't have happened!"" This fallacy can also be taken in a positive sense, e.g. Hitler evidently believed that simply because he was Hitler every bullet would miss him and no explosive could touch him. ""Personalization"" straddles the borderline between a fallacy and a psychopathology. See also, ""The Job's Comforter Fallacy,"" and ""Magical Thinking. ""The Plain Truth Fallacy; (also, the Simple Truth fallacy, Salience Bias, the KISS Principle [Keep it Short and Simple / Keep it Simple, Stupid], the Monocausal Fallacy; the Executive Summary): A fallacy of logos favoring familiar, singular, summarized or easily comprehensible data, examples, explanations and evidence over those that are more complex and unfamiliar but much closer to the truth. E.g., ""Ooooh, look at all those equations and formulas! Just boil it down to the Simple Truth,"" or ""I don't want your damned philosophy lesson! Just tell me the Plain Truth about why this is happening."" A more sophisticated version of this fallacy arbitrarily proposes, as did 18th century Scottish rhetorician John Campbell, that the Truth is always simple by nature and only malicious enemies of Truth would ever seek to make it complicated. (See also, The Snow Job, and Overexplanation.) The opposite of this is the postmodern fallacy of Ineffability or Complexity (also, Truthiness; Post-Truth),, arbitrarily declaring that today's world is so complex that there is no truth, or that Truth (capital-T), if indeed such a thing exists, is unknowable except perhaps by God or the Messiah and is thus forever inaccessible and irrelevant to us mere mortals, making any cogent argument from logos impossible. See also the Big Lie, and Paralysis of Analysis. Plausible Deniability: A vicious fallacy of ethos under which someone in power forces those under his or her control to do some questionable or evil act and to then falsely assume or conceal responsibility for that act in order to protect the ethos of the one in command. E.g., ""Arrange a fatal accident but make sure I know nothing about it! ""Playing on Emotion (also, the Sob Story; the Pathetic Fallacy; the ""Bleeding Heart"" fallacy, the Drama Queen / Drama King Fallacy): The classic fallacy of pure argument from pathos, ignoring facts and evoking emotion alone. E.g., “If you don’t agree that witchcraft is a major problem just shut up, close your eyes for a moment and picture in your mind all those poor moms crying bitter tears for their innocent tiny children whose cozy little beds and happy tricycles lie all cold and abandoned, just because of those wicked old witches! Let's string’em all up!” The opposite of this is the Apathetic Fallacy (also, Cynicism; Burnout; Compassion Fatigue), where any and all legitimate arguments from pathos are brushed aside because, as noted country music artist Jo Dee Messina sang (2005), ""My give-a-damn's busted."" Obverse to Playing on Emotion is the ancient fallacy of Refinement ("" Real Feelings""), where certain classes of living beings such as plants and non-domesticated animals, infants, babies and minor children, barbarians, slaves, deep-sea sailors, farmworkers, criminals and convicts, refugees, addicts, terrorists, Catholics, Jews, foreigners, the poor, people of color, ""Hillbillies,"" ""Hobos,"" homeless or undocumented people, or ""the lower classes"" in general are deemed incapable of experiencing real pain like we do, or of having any "" real feelings"" at all, only brutish appetites, vile lusts, evil drives, filthy cravings, biological instincts, psychological reflexes and automatic tropisms. Noted rhetorician Kenneth Burke falls into this last, behaviorist fallacy in his otherwise brilliant (1966) Language as Symbolic Action, in his discussion of a bird trapped in a lecture room. See also, Othering. Political Correctness (""PC""): A postmodern fallacy, a counterpart of the ""Name Calling"" fallacy, supposing that the nature of a thing or situation can be changed by simply changing its name. E.g., ""Today we strike a blow for animal rights and against cruelty to animals by changing the name of ‘pets’ to ‘animal companions.’"" Or ""Never, ever play the 'victim' card, because it's so manipulative and sounds so negative, helpless and despairing. Instead of being 'victims,' we are proud to be 'survivors.'"" (Of course, when ""victims"" disappear then perpetrators conveniently vanish as well!) See also, The Passive Voice Fallacy, and The Scripted Message. Also applies to other forms of political "" Language Control,"" e.g., being careful never to refer to North Korea or ISIS/ISIL by their rather pompous proper names (""the Democratic People's Republic of Korea"" and ""the Islamic State,"" respectively) or to the Syrian government as the ""Syrian government,"" (It's always the ""Regime"" or the ""Dictatorship.""). Occasionally the fallacy of ""Political Correctness"" is falsely confused with simple courtesy, e.g., ""I'm sick and tired of the tyranny of Political Correctness, having to watch my words all the time--I want to be free to speak my mind and to call out a N----- or a Queer in public any time I damn well feel like it!"" See also, Non-recognition. An opposite of this fallacy is the fallacy of Venting, below. The Pollyanna Principle (also, ""The Projection Bias,"" ""They're Just Like Us,"" ""Singing 'Kumbaya. '""): A traditional, often tragic fallacy of ethos, that of automatically (and falsely) assuming that everyone else in any given place, time and circumstance had or has basically the same (positive) wishes, desires, interests, concerns, ethics and moral code as ""we"" do. This fallacy practically if not theoretically denies both the reality of difference and the human capacity to chose radical evil. E.g., arguing that ""The only thing most Nazi Storm Troopers wanted was the same thing we do, to live in peace and prosperity and to have a good family life,"" when the reality was radically otherwise. Dr. William Lorimer offers this explanation: "" The Projection Bias is the flip side of the 'They're Not Like Us' [Othering] fallacy. The Projection bias (fallacy) is 'They're just people like me, therefore they must be motivated by the same things that motivate me.' For example: 'I would never pull a gun and shoot a police officer unless I was convinced he was trying to murder me; therefore, when Joe Smith shot a police officer, he must have been in genuine fear for his life.' I see the same fallacy with regard to Israel: 'The people of Gaza just want to be left in peace; therefore, if Israel would just lift the blockade and allow Hamas to import anything they want, without restriction, they would stop firing rockets at Israel.' That may or may not be true - I personally don't believe it - but the argument clearly presumes that the people of Gaza, or at least their leaders, are motivated by a desire for peaceful co-existence."" The Pollyanna Principle was gently but expertly demolished in the classic twentieth-century American animated cartoon series, ""The Flintstones,"" in which the humor lay in the absurdity of picturing ""Stone Age"" characters having the same concerns, values and lifestyles as mid-twentieth century white working class Americans. This is the opposite of the Othering fallacy. (Note: The Pollyanna Principle fallacy should not be confused with a psychological principle of the same name which observes that positive memories are usually retained more strongly than negative ones. )The Positive Thinking Fallacy: An immensely popular but deluded modern fallacy of logos, that because we are ""thinking positively"" that in itself somehow biases external, objective reality in our favor even before we lift a finger to act. See also, Magical Thinking. Note that this particular fallacy is often part of a much wider closed-minded, somewhat cultish ideology where the practitioner is warned against paying attention to to or even acknowledging the reality of evil, or of ""negative"" evidence or counter-arguments against his/her standpoints. In the latter case rational discussion, argument or refutation is most often futile. See also, Deliberate Ignorance. The Post Hoc Argument: (also, ""Post Hoc Propter Hoc;"" ""Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc;"" ""Too much of a coincidence,"" the ""Clustering Illusion""): The classic paranoiac fallacy of attributing an imaginary causality to random coincidences, concluding that just because something happens close to, at the same time as, or just after something else, the first thing is caused by the second. E.g., ""AIDS first emerged as a epidemic back in the very same era when Disco music was becoming popular--that's too much of a coincidence: It proves that Disco caused AIDS!"" Correlation does not equal causation. The Pout (also The Silent Treatment; Nonviolent Civil Disobedience; Noncooperation): An often-infantile Argumentum ad Baculum that arbitrarily rejects or gives up on dialogue before it is concluded. The most benign nonviolent form of this fallacy is found in passive-aggressive tactics such as slowdowns, boycotts, lockouts, sitdowns and strikes. Under President Barack Obama the United States finally ended a half-century long political Pout with Cuba. See also ""No Discussion"" and ""Nonrecognition. ""The Procrustean Fallacy (also, ""Keeping up Standards,"" Standardization, Uniformity, Fordism). The modernist fallacy of falsely and inappropriately applying the norms and requirements of standardized manufacturing. quality control and rigid scheduling, or of military discipline to inherently diverse free human beings, their lives, education, behavior, clothing and appearance. This fallacy often seems to stem from the pathological need of someone in power to place in ""order"" their disturbingly free, messy and disordered universe by restricting others' freedom and insisting on rigid standardization, alphabetization, discipline, uniformity and ""objective"" assessment of everyone under their power. This fallacy partially explains why marching in straight lines, mass calisthenics, goose-stepping, drum-and-bugle or flag corps, standing at attention, saluting, uniforms, and standardized categorization are so typical of fascism, tyrannical regimes, and of tyrants petty and grand everywhere. Thanks to author Eimar O'Duffy for identifying this fallacy!Prosopology (also, Prosopography, Reciting the Litany; ""Tell Me, What Were Their Names? ""; Reading the Roll of Martyrs): An ancient fallacy of pathos and ethos, publicly reading out loud, singing, or inscribing at length a list of names (most or all of which will be unknown to the reader or audience), sometimes in a negative sense, to underline the gravity of a past tragedy or mass-casualty event, sometimes in a positive sense, to emphasize the ancient historical continuity of a church, organization or cause. Proper names, especially if they are from the same culture or language group as the audience, can have near-mystical persuasive power. In some cases, those who use this fallacy in its contemporary form will defend it as an attempt to ""personalize"" an otherwise anonymous recent mass tragedy. This fallacy was virtually unknown in secular American affairs before about 100 years ago, when the custom emerged of listing of the names of local World War I casualties on community monuments around the country. That this is indeed a fallacy is evident by the fact that the names on these century-old monuments are now meaningful only to genealogists and specialized historians, just as the names on the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington or the names of those who perished on 9/11 will surely be in another several generations. The Red Herring (also, Distraction): An irrelevant argument, attempting to mislead and distract an audience by bringing up an unrelated but emotionally loaded issue. E.g., ""In regard to my several bankruptcies and recent indictment for corruption let’s be straight up about what’s really important: Terrorism! Just look at what happened last week in [name the place]. Vote for me and I'll fight those terrorists anywhere in the world!"" Also applies to raising unrelated issues as falsely opposing the issue at hand, e.g., ""You say 'Black Lives Matter,' but I would rather say 'Climate Change Matters!'"" when the two contentions are in no way opposed, only competing for attention. See also Availability Bias, and Dog Whistle Politics. Reductio ad Hitlerum (or, ad Hitleram): A highly problematic contemporary historical-revisionist contention that the argument ""That's just what Hitler said (or would have said, or would have done)"" is a fallacy, an instance of the Ad Hominem argument and/or Guilt by Association. Whether the Reductio ad Hitlerum can be considered an actual fallacy or not seems to fundamentally depend on one's personal view of Hitler and the gravity of his crimes. Reductionism: (also, Oversimplifying, Sloganeering): The fallacy of deceiving an audience by giving simple answers or bumper-sticker slogans in response to complex questions, especially when appealing to less educated or unsophisticated audiences. E.g., ""If the glove doesn’t fit, you must vote to acquit."" Or, ""Vote for Snith. He'll bring back jobs!"" In science, technology, engineering and mathematics (""STEM subjects"") reductionism is intentionally practiced to make intractable problems computable, e.g., the well-known humorous suggestion, "" First, let's assume the cow is a sphere! "". See also, the Plain Truth Fallacy, and Dog-whistle Politics. Reifying (also, Mistaking the Map for the Territory): The ancient fallacy of treating imaginary intellectual categories, schemata or names as actual, material ""things."" (E.g., ""The War against Terror is just another chapter in the eternal fight to the death between Freedom and Absolute Evil!"") Sometimes also referred to as "" Essentializing "" or “ Hypostatization .”The Romantic Rebel (also, the Truthdig / Truthout Fallacy ; the Brave Heretic; Conspiracy theories; the Iconoclastic Fallacy): The contemporary fallacy of claiming Truth or validity for one's standpoint solely or primarily because one is supposedly standing up heroically to the dominant ""orthodoxy,"" the current Standard Model, conventional wisdom or Political Correctness, or whatever may be the Bandwagon of the moment; a corrupt argument from ethos. E.g., ""Back in the day the scientific establishment thought that the world was flat, that was until Columbus proved them wrong! Now they want us to believe that ordinary water is nothing but H 2 O. Are you going to believe them? The government is frantically trying to suppress the truth that our public drinking-water supply actually has nitrogen in it and causes congenital vampirism! And what about Area 51? Don't you care? Or are you just a kiss-up for the corrupt scientific establishment?"" The opposite of the Bandwagon fallacy. The ""Save the Children"" Fallacy (also, Humanitarian Crisis): A cruel and cynical contemporary media-driven fallacy of pathos, an instance of the fallacious Appeal to Pity, attracting public support for intervention in somebody else's crisis in a distant country by repeatedly showing in gross detail the extreme (real) suffering of the innocent, defenseless little children (occasionally extended even to their pets!) on ""our"" side, conveniently ignoring the reality that innocent children on all sides usually suffer the most in any war, conflict, famine or crisis. Recent (2017) examples include the so-called ""Rohingya"" in Myanmar/Burma (ignoring multiple other ethnicities suffering ongoing hunger and conflict in that impoverished country), children in rebel-held areas of Syria (areas held by our rebels, not by the Syrian government or by Islamic State rebels), and the children of Mediterranean boat-people (light complected children from the Mideast, Afghanistan and North Africa, but not darker, African-complected children from sub-Saharan countries, children who are evidently deemed by the media to be far less worthy of pity). Scholar Glen Greenwald points out that a cynical key part of this tactic is hiding the child and adult victims of one's own violence while ""milking"" the tragic, blood-soaked images of children killed by the ""other side"" for every tear they can generate as a causus belli [a puffed-up excuse for war, conflict or American/Western intervention]. Scapegoating (also, Blamecasting): The ancient fallacy that whenever something goes wrong there's always someone other than oneself to blame. Although sometimes this fallacy is a practical denial of randomness or chance itself, today it is more often a mere insurance-driven business decision (""I don't care if it was an accident! Somebody with deep pockets is gonna pay for this! ""), though often scapegoating is no more than a cynical ploy to shield those truly responsible from blame. The term ""Scapegoating"" is also used to refer to the tactic of casting collective blame on marginalized or scorned ""Others,"" e.g., ""The Jews are to blame!"" A particularly corrupt and cynical example of scapegoating is the fallacy of Blaming the Victim, in which one falsely casts the blame for one's own evil or questionable actions on those affected, e.g., ""If you move an eyelash I'll have to kill you and you'll be to blame!"" ""If you don't bow to our demands we'll shut down the government and it'll be totally YOUR fault!"" or ""You bi**h, you acted flirty and made me rape you! Then you snitched on me to the cops and let them collect a rape kit on you, and now I'm going to prison and every bit of it is your fault!"" See also, the Affective Fallacy. Scare Tactics (also Appeal to Fear; Paranoia; the Bogeyman Fallacy; Shock Doctrine [Shock Doc]; Rally 'Round the Flag; Rally 'Round the President): A variety of Playing on Emotions, a corrupted argument from pathos, taking advantage of a emergent or deliberately-created crisis and its associated public shock, panic and chaos in order to impose an argument, action or solution that would be clearly unacceptable if carefully considered. E.g., ""If you don't shut up and do what I say we're all gonna die! In this moment of crisis we can't afford the luxury of criticizing or trying to second-guess my decisions when our very lives and freedom are in peril! Instead, we need to be united as one!"" Or, in the (2017) words of former White House Spokesperson Sean Spicer, ""This is about the safety of America!"" This fallacy is discussed at length in Naomi Klein's (2010) The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism and her (2017) No is Not Enough: Resisting Trump's Shock Politics and Winning the World We Need. See also, The Shopping Hungry Fallacy, Dog-Whistle Politics, ""We Have to do Something! "", and The Worst Case Fallacy. ""Scoring"" (also, Moving the Ball Down the Field, the Sports World Fallacy; ""Hey, Sports Fans! ""): An instance of faulty analogy, the common contemporary fallacy of inappropriately and most often offensively applying sports, gaming, hunting or other recreational imagery to unrelated areas of life, such as war or intimacy. E.g., ""Nope, I haven't scored with Francis yet, but last night I managed to get to third base!"" or ""We really need to take our ground game into Kim's half of the field if we ever expect to score against North Korea."" This fallacy is almost always soaked in testosterone and machismo. An associated fallacy is that of Evening up the Score (also, Getting Even), exacting tit-for-tat vengeance as though life were some sort of ""point-score"" sports contest. Counter-arguments to the ""Scoring"" fallacy usually fall on deaf ears, since the one and only purpose for playing a game is to ""score,"" isn't it? The Scripted Message (also, Talking Points): A contemporary fallacy related to Big Lie Technique, where a politician or public figure strictly limits her/his statements on a given issue to repeating carefully scripted, often exaggerated or empty phrases developed to achieve maximum acceptance or maximum desired reaction from a target audience. See also, Dog Whistle Politics, and Political Correctness, above. The opposite of this fallacy is that of ""Venting. ""Sending the Wrong Message: A dangerous fallacy of logos that attacks a given statement, argument or action, no matter how good, true or necessary, because it will ""send the wrong message."" In effect, those who use this fallacy are openly confessing to fraud and admitting that the truth will destroy the fragile web of illusion they have deliberately created by their lies. E.g., ""Actually, we haven't a clue about how to deal with this crisis, but if we publicly admit it we'll be sending the wrong message."" See also, ""Mala Fides. ""Shifting the Burden of Proof : A classic fallacy of logos that challenges an opponent to disprove a claim rather than asking the person making the claim to defend his/her own argument. E.g., ""These days space-aliens are everywhere among us, masquerading as true humans, even right here on campus! I dare you to prove it isn't so! See? You can't! You admit it! That means what I say has to be true. Most probably, you're one of them, since you seem to be so soft on space-aliens!"" A typical tactic in using this fallacy is first to get an opponent to admit that a far-fetched claim, or some fact related to it, is indeed at least theoretically ""possible,"" and then declare the claim ""proven"" absent evidence to the contrary. E.g., ""So you admit that massive undetected voter fraud is indeed possible under our current system, and could have happened in this country at least in theory, and you can't produce even the tiniest scintilla of evidence that it didn't actually happen! Ha-ha! I rest my case."" See also, Argument from Ignorance. The Shopping Hungry Fallacy: A fallacy of pathos, a variety of Playing on Emotions and sometimes Scare Tactics, making stupid but important decisions (or being prompted, manipulated or forced to ""freely"" take public or private decisions that may be later regretted but are difficult to reverse) ""in the heat of the moment"" when under the influence of strong emotion (hunger, fear, lust, anger, sadness, regret, fatigue, even joy, love or happiness). E.g., Trevor Noah, (2016) host of the Daily Show on American television attributes public approval of draconian measures in the Patriot Act and the creation of the U. S. Department of Homeland Security to America's ""shopping hungry"" immediately after 9/11. See also, Scare Tactics; ""We Have to Do Something; "" and The Big ""But"" Fallacy. The Silent Majority Fallacy: A variety of the argument from ignorance, this fallacy, famously enunciated by disgraced American President Richard Nixon, alleges special knowledge of a hidden ""silent majority"" of voters (or of the population in general) that stands in support of an otherwise unpopular leader and his/her policies, contrary to the repeated findings of polls, surveys and popular vote totals. In an extreme case the leader arrogates to him/herself the title of the "" Voice of the Voiceless. ""The Simpleton's Fallacy: (Or, The ""Good Simpleton"" Fallacy): A corrupt fallacy of logos, described in an undated quote from science writer Isaac Asimov as "" T he false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.'"" The name of this fallacy is borrowed from Walter M. Miller Jr.'s classic (1960) post-apocalyptic novel, A Canticle for Leibowitz, in which in the centuries after a nuclear holocaust knowledge and learning become so despised that ""Good Simpleton"" becomes the standard form of interpersonal salutation. This fallacy is masterfully portrayed in the person of the title character in the 1994 Hollywood movie, ""Forrest Gump."" The fallacy is widely alleged to have had a great deal to do with the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election, See also ""Just Plain Folks,"" and the ""Plain Truth Fallacy."" U. S. President Barrack Obama noted to the contrary (2016), ""In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. It's not cool to not know what you're talking about. That's not real or telling it like it is. That's not challenging political correctness. That's just not knowing what you're talking about."" The term ""Simpleton's Fallacy"" has also been used to refer to a deceptive technique of argumentation, feigning ignorance in order to get one's opponent to admit to, explain or overexplain something s/he would rather not discuss. E.g., ""I see here that you have a related prior conviction for something called 'Criminal Sodomy.' I may be a poor, naive simpleton but I'm not quite sure what that fine and fancy lawyer-talk means in plain English. Please explain to the jury in simple terms what exactly you did to get convicted of that crime."" See also, Argument from Ignorance, and The Third Person Effect. The Slippery Slope (also, the Domino Theory): The common fallacy that ""one thing inevitably leads to another."" E.g., ""If you two go and drink coffee together one thing will lead to another and next thing you know you'll be pregnant and end up spending your life on welfare living in the Projects,"" or ""If we close Gitmo one thing will lead to another and before you know it armed terrorists will be strolling through our church doors with suicide belts, proud as you please, smack in the middle of the 10:30 a.m. Sunday worship service right here in Garfield, Kansas! ""The Snow Job (also Falacia ad Verbosium; Information Bias): A fallacy of logos, “proving” a claim by overwhelming an audience (""snowing them under"") with mountains of true but marginally-relevant documents, graphs, words, facts, numbers, information and statistics that look extremely impressive but which the intended audience cannot be expected to understand or properly evaluate. This is a corrupted argument from logos. See also, ""Lying with Statistics."" The opposite of this fallacy is the Plain Truth Fallacy. The Soldiers' Honor Fallacy: The ancient fallacy that all who wore a uniform, fought hard and followed orders are worthy of some special honor or glory or are even ""heroes,"" whether they fought for freedom or fought to defend slavery, marched under Grant or Lee, Hitler, Stalin, Eisenhower or Mc Arthur, fought to defend their homes, fought for oil or to spread empire, or even fought against and killed U. S. soldiers! A corrupt argument from ethos (that of a soldier), closely related to the ""Finish the Job"" fallacy (""Sure, he died for a lie, but he deserves honor because he followed orders and did his job faithfully to the end!""). See also ""Heroes All."" This fallacy was recognized and decisively refuted at the Nuremburg Trials after World War II but remains powerful to this day nonetheless. See also ""Blind Loyalty."" Related is the State Actor Fallacy, that those who fight and die for their country (America, Russia, Iran, the Third Reich, etc.) are worthy of honor or at least pardonable while those who fight for a non-state actor (armed abolitionists, guerrillas, freedom-fighters, jihadis, mujahideen) are not and remain ""terrorists"" no matter how noble or vile their cause, until or unless they win and become the recognized state, or are adopted by a state after the fact. The Standard Version Fallacy: The ancient fallacy, a discursive Argumentum ad Baculum, of choosing a ""Standard Translation"" or ""Authorized Version"" of an ancient or sacred text and arbitrarily declaring it ""correct"" and ""authoritative,"" necessarily eliminating much of the poetry and underlying meaning of the original but conveniently quashing any further discussion about the meaning of the original text, e.g., the Vulgate or The King James Version. The easily demonstrable fact that translation (beyond three or four words) is neither uniform nor reversible (i.e., never comes back exactly the same when retranslated from another language) gives the lie to any efforts to make translation of human languages into an exact science. Islam clearly recognizes this fallacy when characterizing any attempt to translate the sacred text of the Holy Qur'an out of the original Arabic as a ""paraphrase"" at very best. An obverse of this fallacy is the Argumentum ad Mysteriam, above. An extension of the Standard Version Fallacy is the Monolingual Fallacy, at an academic level the fallacy of ignorantly assuming (as a monolingual person) that transparent, in-depth translation between languages is the norm, or even possible at all, allowing one to conveniently and falsely ignore everyday issues of translation when close-reading translated literature or academic text and theory. At the popular level the Monolingual Fallacy allows monolinguals to blithely demand that visitors, migrants, refugees and newcomers learn English, either before arriving or else overnight after arrival in the United States, while applying no such demand to themselves when they go to Asia, Europe, Latin America, or even French-speaking areas of Canada. Not rarely, this fallacy descends into gross racism or ethnic discrimination, e.g., the demagogy of warning of ""Spanish being spoken right here on Main Street and taco trucks on every corner!"" See also, Othering, and Dog-Whistle Politics. Star Powe r (also Testimonial, Questionable Authority, Faulty Use of Authority, Falacia ad Vericundiam; Eminence-based Practice): In academia and medicine, a corrupt argument from ethos in which arguments, standpoints and themes of professional discourse are granted fame and validity or condemned to obscurity solely by whoever may be the reigning ""stars"" or ""premier journals"" of the profession or discipline at the moment. E.g., ""Foster's take on Network Theory has been thoroughly criticized and is so last-week!. This week everyone's into Safe Spaces and Pierce's Theory of Microaggressions. Get with the program."" (See also, the Bandwagon.) Also applies to an obsession with journal Impact Factors. At the popular level this fallacy also refers to a corrupt argument from ethos in which public support for a standpoint or product is established by a well-known or respected figure (i.e.,. a star athlete or entertainer) who is not an expert and who may have been well paid to make the endorsement (e.g., “Olympic gold-medal pole-vaulter Fulano de Tal uses Quick Flush Internet--Shouldn’t you?"" Or, ""My favorite rock star warns that vaccinations spread cooties, so I'm not vaccinating my kids!"" ). Includes other false, meaningless or paid means of associating oneself or one’s product or standpoint with the ethos of a famous person or event (e.g., “Try Salsa Cabria, the official taco sauce of the Winter Olympics!”). This fallacy also covers Faulty use of Quotes (also, The Devil Quotes Scripture), including quoting out of context or against the clear intent of the original speaker or author. E.g., racists quoting and twisting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s statements in favor of racial equality against contemporary activists and movements for racial equality. The Straw Man (also ""The Straw Person"" """"The Straw Figure""): The fallacy of setting up a phony, weak, extreme or ridiculous parody of an opponent's argument and then proceeding to knock it down or reduce it to absurdity with a rhetorical wave of the hand. E.g., ""Vegetarians say animals have feelings like you and me. Ever seen a cow laugh at a Shakespeare comedy? Vegetarianism is nonsense!"" Or, ""Pro-choicers hate babies and want to kill them!"" Or, ""Pro-lifers hate women and want them to spend their lives barefoot, pregnant and chained to the kitchen stove!"" A too-common example of this fallacy is that of highlighting the most absurd, offensive, silly or violent examples in a mass movement or demonstration, e.g. ""Tree huggers"" for environmentalists, ""bra burners"" for feminists, or ""rioters"" when there are a dozen violent crazies in a peaceful, disciplined demonstration of thousands or tens of thousands, and then falsely portraying these extreme examples as typical of the entire movement in order to condemn it with a wave of the hand. See also Olfactory Rhetoric. The Taboo (also, Dogmatism):: The ancient fallacy of unilaterally declaring certain ""bedrock"" arguments, assumptions, dogmas, standpoints or actions ""sacrosanct"" and not open to discussion, or arbitrarily taking some emotional tones, logical standpoints, doctrines or options ""off the table"" beforehand. (E.g., "" ""No, let's no t discuss my sexuality,"" ""Don't bring my drinking into this,"" or ""Before we start, you need to know I won't allow you to play the race card or permit you to attack my arguments by claiming 'That's just what Hitler would say!'"") Also applies to discounting or rejecting certain arguments, facts and evidence (or even experiences!) out of hand because they are supposedly ""against the Bible"" or other sacred dogma (See also the A Priori Argument). This fallacy occasionally degenerates into a separate, distracting argument over who gets to define the parameters, tones, dogmas and taboos of the main argument, though at this point reasoned discourse most often breaks down and the entire affair becomes a naked Argumentum ad Baculum. See also, MYOB, Tone Policing, and Calling ""Cards. ""They're All Crooks: The common contemporary fallacy of refusing to get involved in public politics because ""all"" politicians and politics are allegedly corrupt, ignoring the fact that if this is so in a democratic country it is precisely because decent people like you and I refuse to get involved, leaving the field open to the ""crooks"" by default. An example of Circular Reasoning. Related to this fallacy is "" They're All Biased ,"" the extremely common contemporary cynical fallacy of ignoring news and news media because none tells the ""objective truth"" and all push some ""agenda."" This basically true observation logically requiring audiences to regularly view or read a variety of media sources in order to get any approximation of reality, but for many younger people today (2017) it means in practice, ""Ignore news, news media and public affairs altogether and instead pay attention to something that's fun, exciting or personally interesting to you ."" The sinister implication for democracy is, ""Mind your own business and leave all the 'big' questions to your betters, those whose job is to deal with these questions and who are well paid to do so."" See also the Third Person Effect, and Deliberate Ignorance. The ""Third Person Effect"" (also, ""Wise up!"" and ""They're All Liars""): An example of the fallacy of Deliberate Ignorance, the arch-cynical postmodern fallacy of deliberately discounting or ignoring media information a priori, opting to remain in ignorance rather than ""listening to the lies"" of the mainstream media, the President, the ""medical establishment,"" professionals, professors, doctors and the ""academic elite"" or other authorities or information sources, even about urgent subjects (e.g., the need for vaccinations) on which these sources are otherwise publicly considered to be generally reliable or relatively trustworthy. According to Drexel University researchers (2017), the ""Third Person Effect ... suggests that individuals will perceive a mass media message to have more influence on others, than themselves. This perception tends to counteract the message's intended 'call-to-action.' Basically, this suggests that over time people wised up to the fact that some mass media messages were intended to manipulate them -- so the messages became less and less effective."" This fallacy seems to be opposite to and an overreaction to the Big Lie Technique. See also, Deliberate Ignorance, the Simpleton's Fallacy, and Trust your Gut. The ""Thousand Flowers"" Fallacy (also, ""Take names and kick butt. ""): A sophisticated, modern ""Argumentum ad Baculum"" in which free and open discussion and ""brainstorming"" are temporarily allowed and encouraged (even demanded) within an organization or country not primarily in order to hear and consider opposing views, but rather to ""smoke out,"" identify and later punish, fire or liquidate dissenters or those not following the Party Line. The name comes from the Thousand Flowers Period in Chinese history when Communist leader Chairman Mao Tse Tung applied this policy with deadly effect. Throwing Good Money After Bad (also, ""Sunk Cost Fallacy""): In his excellent book, Logically Fallacious (2015), Author Bo Bennett describes this fallacy as follows: ""Reasoning that further investment is warranted on the fact that the resources already invested will be lost otherwise, not taking into consideration the overall losses involved in the further investment."" In other words, risking additional money to ""save"" an earlier, losing investment, ignoring the old axiom that ""Doing the same thing and expecting different results is the definition of insanity."" E.g., ""I can't stop betting now, because I already bet the rent and lost, and I need to win it back or my wife will kill me when I get home!"" See also Argument from Inertia. TINA (There Is No Alternative. Also the ""Love it or Leave It"" Fallacy; ""Get over it,"" ""Suck it up,"" ""It is what it is,"" ""Actions/Elections have consequences,"" or the ""Fait Accompli""): A very common contemporary extension of the either/or fallacy in which someone in power quashes critical thought by announcing that there is no realistic alternative to a given standpoint, status or action, arbitrarily ruling any and all other options out of bounds, or announcing that a decision has been made and any further discussion is insubordination, disloyalty, treason, disobedience or simply a waste of precious time when there's a job to be done. (See also, ""Taboo;"" ""Finish the Job."") TINA is most often a naked power-play, a slightly more sophisticated variety of the Argumentum ad Baculum. See also Appeal to Closure. Tone Policing. A corrupt argument from pathos and delivery, the fallacy of judging the validity of an argument primarily by its emotional tone of delivery, ignoring the reality that a valid fact or argument remains valid whether it is offered calmly and deliberatively or is shouted in a ""shrill"" or even ""hysterical"" tone, whether carefully written and published in professional, academic language in a respected, peer-reviewed journal or screamed through a bull-horn and peppered with vulgarity. Conversely, a highly urgent emotional matter is still urgent even if argued coldly and rationally. This fallacy creates a false dichotomy between reason and emotion and thus implicitly favors those who are not personally involved or emotionally invested in an argument, e.g., ""I know you're upset, but I won't discuss it with you until you calm down,"" or ""I'd believe what you wrote were it not for your adolescent overuse of exclamation points throughout the text."" Or alternately, ""You seem to be taking the death of your spouse way too calmly. You're under arrest for homicide. You have the right to remain silent..."" Tone Policing is frequent in contemporary discourse of power, particularly in response to discourse of protest, and is occasionally used in sexist ways, e.g. the accusation of being ""shrill"" is almost always used against women, never against men. See also, The F-Bomb. Transfer: (also, Name Dropping) A corrupt argument from ethos, falsely associating a famous or respected person, place or thing with an unrelated thesis or standpoint (e.g. putting a picture of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on an advertisement for mattresses, using Genghis Khan, a Mongol who hated Chinese, as the name of a Chinese restaurant, or using the Texas flag to sell more cars or pickups in Texas that were made in Detroit, Kansas City or Korea). This fallacy is common in contemporary academia in the form of using a profusion of scholarly-looking citations from respected authorities to lend a false gravitas to otherwise specious ideas or text. See also ""Star Power. ""Trust your Gut (also, Trust your Heart; Trust Your Feelings; Trust your Intuition; Trust your Instincts; Emotional Reasoning): A corrupt argument from pathos, the ancient fallacy of relying primarily on ""gut feelings"" rather than reason or evidence to make decisions. A recent (2017) Ohio State University study finds, unsurprisingly, that people who ""trust their gut"" are significantly more susceptible to falling for ""fake news,"" phony conspiracy theories, frauds and scams than those who insist on hard evidence or logic. See also Deliberate Ignorance, the Affective Fallacy, and The ""Third Person Effect. ""Tu Quoque (""You Do it Too! ""; also, Two Wrongs Make a Right): A corrupt argument from ethos, the fallacy of defending a shaky or false standpoint or excusing one's own bad action by pointing out that one's opponent's acts, ideology or personal character are also open to question, or are perhaps even worse than one's own. E.g., ""Sure, we may have tortured prisoners and killed kids with drones, but we don't cut off heads like they do!"" Or, ""You can't stand there and accuse me of corruption! You guys are all into politics and you know what we have to do to get reelected!"" Unusual, self-deprecating variants on this fallacy are the Ego / Nos Quoque Fallacies (""I / we do it too! ""), minimizing or defending another's evil actions because I am / we are guilty of the same thing or of even worse. E.g., In response to allegations that Russian Premier Vladimir Putin is a ""killer,"" American President Donald Trump (2/2017) told an interviewer, ""There are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country's so innocent?"" This fallacy is related to the Red Herring and to the Ad Hominem Argument. Two-sides Fallacy (also, Teach the Controversy): The presentation of an issue that makes it seem to have two sides of equal weight or significance, when in fact a consensus or much stronger argument supports just one side. Also called “false balance” or “false equivalence.” (Thanks to Teaching Tolerance for this definition!) E.g,. ""Scientists theorize that the Earth is a sphere, but there are always two sides to any argument: Others believe that the Earth is flat and is perched on the back of a giant turtle, and a truly balanced presentation of the issue requires teaching both explanations without bias or unduly favoring either side over the other. ""Two Truths ( also, Compartmentalization; Epistemically Closed Systems; Alternative Truth): A very corrupt and dangerous fallacy of logos and ethos, first formally described in medieval times but still common today, holding that there exists one ""truth"" in one given environment (e.g., in science, work or school) and simultaneously a different, formally contradictory but equally true ""truth"" in a different epistemic system, context, environment, intended audience or discourse community (e.g., in one's religion or at home). This can lead to a situation of stable cognitive dissonance where, as UC Irvine scholar Dr. Carter T. Butts describes it (2016), ""I know but don't believe,"" making rational discussion difficult, painful or impossible. This fallacy also describes the discourse of politicians who cynically proclaim one ""truth"" as mere ""campaign rhetoric"" used ""to mobilize the base,"" or ""for domestic consumption only,"" and a quite different and contradictory ""truth"" for more general or practical purposes once in office. See also Disciplinary Blinders; Alternative Truth. Venting (also, Letting off Steam; Loose Lips): In the Venting fallacy a person argues that her/his words are or ought to be exempt from criticism or consequence because s/he was ""only venting,"" even though this very admission implies that the one ""venting"" was, at long last, freely expressing his/her true, heartfelt and uncensored opinion about the matter in question. This same fallacy applies to minimizing, denying the significance of or excusing other forms of frank, unguarded or uninhibited offensive expression as mere "" Locker-room Talk ,"" "" Alpha-male Speech "" or nothing but cute, adorable, perhaps even sexy "" Bad-boy Talk ."" See also, the Affective Fallacy. Opposite to this fallacy are the fallacies of Political Correctness and the Scripted Message, above. Venue: The ancient fallacy of Venue, a corrupt argument from kairos, falsely and arbitrarily invalidates an otherwise-valid argument or piece of evidence because it is supposedly offered in the wrong place, at the wrong moment or in an inappropriate court, medium or forum. According to Ph D student Amanda Thran, ""Quite often, people will say to me in person that Facebook, Twitter, etc. are 'not the right forums' for discussing politically and socially sensitive issues. ... In this same vein, I’ve also encountered the following argument: 'Facebook, which is used for sharing wedding, baby, and pet photos, is an inappropriate place for political discourse; people don’t wished to be burdened with that when they log in.' In my experience, this line of reasoning is most often employed (and abused) to shut down a conversation when one feels they are losing it. Ironically, I have seen it used when the argument has already been transpiring on the platform [in] an already lengthy discussion."" See also Disciplinary Blinders. We Have to Do Something: (also, the Placebo Effect; Political Theater; Security Theater; We have to send a message): The dangerous contemporary fallacy that when ""People are scared / People are angry / People are fed up / People are hurting / People want change"" it becomes necessary to do something, anything, at once without stopping to ask ""What?"" or ""Why? "", even if what is done is an overreaction, is a completely ineffective sham, an inert placebo, or actually makes the situation worse, rather than ""just sitting there doing nothing."" (E.g., ""Banning air passengers from carrying ham sandwiches onto the plane and making parents take off their newborn infants' tiny pink baby-shoes probably does nothing to deter potential terrorists, but people are scared and we have to do something to respond to this crisis!"") This is a badly corrupted argument from pathos. (See also ""Scare Tactic"" and ""The Big 'But' Fallacy. "")Where there’s Smoke, there’s Fire (also Hasty Conclusion; Jumping to a Conclusion): The dangerous fallacy of ignorantly drawing a snap conclusion and/or taking action without sufficient evidence. E.g., “Captain! The guy sitting next to me in coach has dark skin and is reading a book in some kind of funny language all full of accent marks, weird squiggles above the ""N's"" and upside-down question marks. It must be Arabic! Get him off the plane before he blows us all to kingdom come!” A variety of the “Just in Case” fallacy. The opposite of this fallacy is the ""Paralysis of Analysis. ""The Wisdom of the Crowd (also, The Magic of the Market; the Wikipedia Fallacy; Crowdsourcing): A very common contemporary fallacy that individuals may be wrong but ""the crowd"" or ""the market"" is infallible, ignoring historic examples like witch-burning, lynching, and the market crash of 2008. This fallacy is why most American colleges and universities currently (2017) ban students from using Wikipedia as a serious reference source. The Worst-Case Fallacy (also, ""Just in case;"" ""We can't afford to take chances;"" ""An abundance of caution;"" ""Better Safe than Sorry;"" ""Better to prevent than to lament. ""): A pessimistic fallacy by which one’s reasoning is based on an improbable, far-fetched or even completely imaginary worst-case scenario rather than on reality. This plays on pathos (fear) rather than reason, and is often politically motivated. E.g., ""What if armed terrorists were to attack your county grain elevator tomorrow morning at dawn? Are you ready to fight back? Better stock up on assault rifles and ammunition today, just in case!"" See also Scare Tactics. The opposite of this is the Positive Thinking Fallacy. The Worst Negates the Bad (also, Be Grateful for What You've Got): The extremely common modern logical fallacy that an objectively bad situation somehow isn't so bad simply because it could have been far worse, or because someone, somewhere has it even worse. E.g., ""I cried because I had no shoes, until I saw someone who had no feet."" Or, ""You're protesting because you earn only $7.25 an hour? You could just as easily be out on the street! I happen to know there are people in Uttar Pradesh who are doing the very same work you're doing for one tenth of what you're making, and they're pathetically glad just to have work at all. You need to shut up, put down that picket sign, get back to work for what I care to pay you, and thank me each and every day for giving you a job! ""Zero Tolerance (also, Zero Risk Bias, Broken Windows Policing, Disproportionate Response; Even One is Too Many; Exemplary Punishment; Judenrein): The contemporary fallacy of declaring an ""emergency"" and promising to disregard justice and due process and devote unlimited resources (and occasionally, unlimited cruelty) to stamp out a limited, insignificant or even nonexistent problem. E.g., ""I just read about an actual case of cannibalism somewhere in this country. That's disgusting, and even one case is way, way too many! We need a Federal Taskforce against Cannibalism with a million-dollar budget and offices in every state, a national SCAN program in all the grade schools (Stop Cannibalism in America Now! ), and an automatic double death penalty for cannibals; in other words, zero tolerance for cannibalism in this country!"" This is a corrupt and cynical argument from pathos, almost always politically driven, a particularly sinister variety of Dog Whistle Politics and the ""We Have to do Something"" fallacy. See also, ""Playing on Emotions,"" ""Red Herring,"" and also the ""Big Lie Technique. ""OW 7/06 with thanks to the late Susan Spence.

In this transformative facility, using a combination of high tech mannequins, standardized patients, and actors, students will be challenged to respond to an individual who walks into the six-bed emergency department with, for example, neck pain, and while that patient is undergoing standard diagnostic procedures, a “trauma victim” who arrives in the ambulance bay is evaluated and rushed upstairs to one of the third floor’s four operating room suites for lifesaving surgery. Meanwhile, an “expectant mother” arrives and is admitted to the third floor labor and delivery suite; her “newborn infant” will be admitted to the nearby neonatal intensive care unit or newborn nursery, depending on its health status. Meanwhile, a combination of medical-surgical hospital rooms and an apartment (homecare) setting facilitate valuable lessons in palliative and hospice care. 
D3073469	http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2013/02/27/reasons-you-should-buy-a-franchise-and-reasons-you-shouldnt	Reasons You Should Buy a Franchise (and Reasons You Shouldnât)	" (i Stock Photo)So you're thinking of buying a franchise? Chances are, if you've thought of striking out on your own and starting a business, somebody has suggested that you buy one. Odds are also good that someone you also know has urged you not to buy a franchise. For those who aren't familiar with the concept, here's a quick recap: Mc Donald's is a franchise, and so is Subway, Jiffy Lube, Supercuts—the list runs into the thousands. Almost any time you go into a store that you can find anywhere else in the country, you're in a franchise (although there are exceptions, like Starbucks and Barnes & Noble, both of which only have company-operated outlets). An individual can buy into the franchise, often spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to run a UPS Store, a Domino's Pizza, a Gymboree, and so on. The franchisee then pays an ongoing franchise royalty fee out of its sales to the corporation, such as the Wendy's International headquarters, or the Ace Hardware Corporation. Whatever's left over, and hopefully it's a lot, the franchisee keeps. That sums up franchising in its most basic sense, and your friends and colleagues are all right. There are good reasons to buy a franchise—and good reasons not to. Here are the positives:1. You want to work for yourself. As Joel Libava, a franchise consultant who runs The Franchise King.com, says, ""Becoming a franchise owner is a great way to avoid ever having to deal with a tough job market ever again."" [See The 25 Best Jobs of 2013 . ]But it isn't utopia in the franchise world. You'll have the franchisor's corporate headquarters to deal with—the mothership, if you will. This isn't a relationship that will likely work for someone who is completely headstrong and independent. For instance, if you own a Mc Donald's, while you can do things like hire and fire employees, you can't paint the golden arches purple. But that's a good thing. You don't buy a franchise because you want to change it. You buy it because it's a tried-and-tested business model.2. You're excited about hard work. Many people buy a franchise expecting a ""business in a box."" The misconception is that you open the doors, customers will come, and it'll run itself. There's no guarantee that will happen, though, especially if the brand name isn't one that everyone is intimately familiar with. ""You need to be motivated and willing to put time and energy into your franchised business, to make your investment pay off, and you must follow the franchisor's system down to the letter,"" says Cheryl Babcock, director of the International Institute for Franchise Education at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Many people get an adrenaline rush from running a business, and if that's how you roll, consider buying a franchise.3. You don't want to take too much of a risk. The advantages of going into franchising, says Babcock, are that you have the ""experience of the franchisor and the system's established franchisees who can guide and support you. ""She says a good franchisor will offer ongoing training and support; nobody's going to hand you the keys and expect you to magically understand how a Jiffy Lube is run. Another plus, she says, is the ""buying power and efficiencies of scale in the franchise system. The franchisor can negotiate lower prices for the products and services you need to run your business. ""Buying a franchise also comes with some negatives that anyone looking to jump in would be foolish not to consider:1. It is expensive. You might have some great experience in managing a business, but unless you have deep pockets or stellar credit and can get business loans (or perhaps a wealthy partner who can pony up the cash while you do the rest of the work), buying a franchise is next to impossible. In 2004, Robert Saunders and with wife, Tinamarie, now 56 and 47, bought a UPS Store in Long Beach, Calif., while they were both still employed at Southern California Edison, where they continued to work while their staff kept their business humming; during the weekends, evenings, and vacation time, they worked on their UPS business. Because they didn't have the money outright to buy the UPS Store, they took out a $150,000 Small Business Administration (SBA) loan to buy into the franchise. That still wasn't quite enough: They also had to borrow $50,000 from their house and 401 (k). [Read: Should You Save or Pay Off Debt? ]Their experience is typical. Franchises can cost as low as tens of thousands of dollars to a little north of a million, which is what anyone buying a Mc Donald's can expect to pay, or even more (a Denny's will cost you $2 million). Why are these businesses so expensive? You're paying for everything from leasing commercial property to buying inventory and equipment to paying the one-time franchise fee, which gives you permission to use the franchisor's signage and logo. For comparison's sake, Subway's franchise fee is $15,000. Mr. Rooter, the plumbing service, has a $29,500 franchise fee. You'll also pay the corporate office an ongoing royalty fee every year, which is essentially a percentage of your business's sales, and you may have to contribute to a marketing fund.2. It may be less risky than starting your own business, but it is still a risk. The UPS Store is a strong brand, but the recent recession was strong, too, and when the economy cracked several years ago, the Saunders' store couldn't withstand it. ""Customers who had been doing next-day air packages, which had a better profit margin, began saying, 'Well, it doesn't need to get there tomorrow. It can get there in three or four days,'"" recalls Robert Saunders, adding that small businesses that rented mailboxes from them began shutting down as well. ""That was our bread and butter,"" he says. In 2009, they closed their business, five years in the middle of a 10-year contract. After UPS adhered to its formula for franchisees breaking contracts, the couple wound up paying a fee of $23,000 to their franchisor. [See 10 Golden Parachutes That Will Make Your Head Spin . ]But it's not all gloom and doom. Robert Saunders, who retired from Edison in 2011, still speaks well of the UPS Store, and being a franchisee gave him an idea for the business he and his wife started in 2010: College Storage & Student Services, which stores belongings for college students who can't take their furniture and belongings with them back home and can't leave them in the dorm or their apartment over the summer. ""We saw a lot of college students coming into the UPS Store, needing to ship things and being stressed out,"" he says. So owning a franchise helped them, and it hurt them. The Saunderses, in fact, won't forget their experiences any time soon. Four years after closing their UPS Store and nine years after opening it, they are still paying off their SBA loan.

Comics just aren't a great monetary investment; for the average book you pick up, its resale value drops to somewhere between a dollar and a nickel if you want to unload it on the next guy. Their value, of course, lies in their stories; you buy comics because they're awesome to read, not because they'll make you rich. But, of course, there are exceptions. Some comics—old, important ones especially—are like their own little money fountain. We've compiled a list of the five most valuable comics out there, as well as the highest prices they've sold for. Why the difference? Well, because as with anything else, values are somewhat theoretical, based on what people are actually willing to pay for something when it goes up for sale—and a lot of these old guys don't go on sale very often. Furthermore, when it comes to collecting comics, condition is important, and a lot of the classic books don't pop up in anything close to mint condition, although a leading online price guide from which we've obtained these values pretends that somewhere out there 9.4-condition copies of all these books (on a 10.0 scale) exist.1. Action Comics #1 (released June 1938; price guide value: $4.3 mil for a 9.4; highest sale on record: $2.16 mil for a 9.0 copy) For anyone who follows comics, this is no surprise. Action Comics #1 is the granddaddy of them all—the first superhero comic, the first American comic of all-original material (up to that point comics had been mostly reprints of Sunday funnies), the introductions of Superman, perennial love interest Lois Lane, and also DC Comics magician Zatara… this is big stuff. No wonder people pay millions for it. Collectors beware: LOTS of less-valuable (though not necessarily worthless) reprints of this book exist, so if you think you've got an Action #1 on your hands, CHECK ITS AUTHENTICITY.2. Detective Comics #27 (released May 1939; price guide value: $4.23 mil for a 9.4; highest sale on record: 1.07 mil for a 8.0 copy) Right on Superman's heels is Detective Comics #27, the debut of the Caped Crusader, Batman, as well as his crime-fighting ally Commissioner Gordon. It seems that Superman and Batman are not just the yin and yang of the DC Universe, but of comic book value as well.3. Superman #1 (released summer 1939; price guide value: $747k for a 9.4; highest sale on record: $250k for a 7.5 copy) This is a little confusing, right? Even though Superman debuted in Action Comics #1 in June 1938, he didn't get a book with his name on it until a year later. By then the comic-reading public was smitten with Superman, and every publisher wanted their own version of the hero, but DC's (at the time called National) was still selling the most popular one. Still, this book is pretty clearly just a cash-grab; it reprints the Superman stories from Action Comics #1-4 with only a few pages of new material to spice it up.4. Marvel Comics #1 (released October 1939; price guide value: $557k for a 9.4; highest sale on record: $367k, condition unverified) For all you DC haters, it must be nice to see the OTHER major company on this list, right? This book marks the first appearance of the Human Torch (not the one on the Fantastic Four, but an earlier android version of the character) and also kicks off the Marvel Universe, though at the time the company that published it was called Timely. Characters like Namor and Captain America would soon follow, and eventually DC/National would have a big-time competitor.5. Batman #1 (released spring 1940; price guide value: $501k for a 9.4; highest sale on record: $315k for a 9.0 copy) Much as it took Superman a year to get a comic all to himself, Batman did the same. However, unlike Superman, Batman's first solo issue was mostly original material, and includes the first appearances of the Joker, Hugo Strange, and Catwoman (then called ""The Cat""). Of all these comics, Batman #1 probably reads as the most modern (and technically it is, though it's still 62 years old); in fact, Christopher Nolan lifted part of its Joker plot for his 2008 film The Dark Knight.

"Answer 1: This is one of the most important questions in biology since the cell is the smallest unit of life in either a plant or an animal and without it no living thing would survive. No matter what organism the cell comes from it has the same basic functions. Cells must be able to get nutrients from the environment, make new cells (reproduce) and use the nutrients to make energy for the organism they are a part of. There are many, many, many other things a cell can do in addition to there three things, for example, cells get rid of waste, send electrical signals to the brain, fight off disease, carry oxygen through the body and in the case of plants they make energy from sunlight. Although, the overall function of the cell is the same, there are some important differences between animal and plant cells. The first difference is that plant cells have an organelle called chloroplast. Chloroplasts contain a pigment called chlorophyll (which gives the plant its green color). Chlorophyll is able to capture the energy from the sun. In doing this a series of chemical reactions occur that convert the suns energy into ATP (energy for the plant). The second main difference is in the structure of the cell itself. Animal cells are smaller than plant cells and have a membrane around them that is flexible and allows molecules, gases and nutrients to pass into the cell. Plant cells are larger and in addition to a membrane they have a rigid cell wall. The cell wall does not let any material pass so instead the plants cells must have tiny openings between cells like doors between rooms in your house. These ""doors"" are called plasmodesmata. The plant cell wall provides protection to the plant cell just like the animal cell does. Here is a really nice table I found on line that lists similarities and differences between the two. In case your curiosity gets the best of you.table 1 "

Social interactions are the processes by which we act and react to those around us. Let's examine the different types of social interactions and test your knowledge with a quiz. Social Interaction Erving Goffman was a sociologist who created a new field of study called microsociology, or social interaction. Social interaction is the process by which we act and react to those around us. In a nutshell, social interaction includes those acts people perform toward each other and the responses they give in return. Having a quick conversation with a friend seems relatively trivial. Goffman argued that these seemingly insignificant forms of social interaction are of major importance in sociology and should not be overlooked. Social interactions include a large number of behaviors, so many that in sociology, interaction is usually divided into five categories. These are: exchange, competition, cooperation, conflict and coercion. Let's examine these five types with a bit more detail. Exchange Exchange is the most basic type of social interaction. Whenever people interact in an effort to receive a reward or a return for their actions, an exchange has taken place. Exchange is a social process whereby social behavior is exchanged for some type of reward for equal or greater value. The reward can be material (a paycheck at a job) or nonmaterial (a 'thank you' from your coworker). Exchange theorists argue that behavior that is rewarded tends to be repeated; however, when the costs of an interaction outweigh the rewards, individuals are likely to end the relationship. Competition Competition is a process by which two or more people attempt to achieve a goal that only one can attain. Competition is a common feature of Western societies and the cornerstone of the capitalist economic system and the democratic form of government. Most sociologists view competition as a positive thing - one that can motivate people to achieve goals. However, competition can also lead to psychological stress, a lack of cooperation in social relationships, inequality and even conflict. Cooperation Cooperation is the process in which people work together to achieve shared goals. Cooperation is a social process that gets things done; no group can complete its tasks or achieve its goals without cooperation from its members. Oftentimes, cooperation works together with other forms of interaction, such as competition. In a baseball game, for example, a team will work together (cooperation) while attempting to achieve a victory (a goal that only one team can attain).

The Logical Song was written by Roger Hodgson who won the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters for this song. Roger and Rick wrote separately and the songs they sung on the albums were the songs they wrote. Roger Hodgson is also known as the voice of Supertramp and the majority of songs Roger wrote like Dreamer, Breakfast in America, Give a Little Bit, Take the Long Way Home and so many others.. When Roger left the band Rick Davies got the rights to the name Supertramp and Roger Hodgson got his songs. Supertramp isn't touring anymore - although on a better note, singer-songwriter and co-founder of the band, Roger Hodgson is playing shows all over the world on his Breakfast in America Tour, backed by a talented and close-knit band! Fans haven't been happier to experience the magic and magnificence of the songs they grew up with, from the tunesmith that composed them from his very own heart and life experiences. And for Roger's latest concert schedule, go to his tour page to book your tickets and don't miss out -- http://www.rogerhodgson.com/documents... Roger sounds even better today. I feel he sings from his heart and soul and that touches me when I hear him sing. He has a way of sharing his music that I find profound and touching. Another artist who is similar is John Fogerty of Credence Clearwater Revival. I love to hear John sing his songs and there's no comparison for me when I hear the band Credence Clearwater Revisited sing John's songs. The bands Supertamp and Credence Clearwater Revisited just don't sound like the real deal.

Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulhu“ That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die. „~ H. P. Lovecraft, Necronomicon“ [At the proper time,] the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from his tomb to revive His subjects and resume his rule of Earth. „~ Castro on Cthulhu. Cthulhu is a creation of the famed horror author H. P. Lovecraft, who serves as the titiular character and a major antagonist of his fictional universe, the Cthulhu Mythos , first appearing as the main antagonist in the 1928 story, The Call of Cthulhu . He is one of the primary Great Old Ones of Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, a race of alien deities that are comparable to cosmic beings and archdemons in other works of fantasy. Cthulhu is infamously known for his grotesque appearance and gigantic size, as well as his ability to drive any human that gazes upon his form to insanity. While he is not the most powerful of Lovecraft's creations (dwarfed by Outer Gods like Yog-Sothoth and Azathoth ), he is easily the most famous, and his name has become associated with evil and Lovecraftian horror ever since the creature was first brought to public attention in the 1920s. Contents [ show]History Cthulhu was born on the planet Vhoorl, located in the 23rd nebula. He traveled to the star Zoth where he spawned his offspring. Along with his children and the Star Spawn of Cthulhu, Cthulhu travelled to Saturn and then to Earth. They landed on a continent in the Pacific Ocean and built the city, R'lyeh. Cthulhu received resistance from the Elder Things who also lived on the planet. They waged war for the planet Earth until a truce was made. Cthulhu then went into a deep hibernation within R'lyeh. Humanity then evolved on Earth and Cthulhu communicated with several through dreams, resulting in the Cult of Cthulhu. Disaster then struck R'lyeh, sinking it into the ocean. R'lyeh has risen from the ocean for brief amounts of time. However, it is fated that R'lyeh will rise from the ocean permanently and Cthulhu will retake the world. Appearance Cthulhu's appearance can change from story to story, but he is most often portrayed as a monster of vaguely humanoid shape with a squid-like face and wings. He is also considered terrifyingly large and apocalyptic, being the size of a mountain (or bigger in some accounts). Most descriptions of him stem from statuettes found in the possession of cult members; they are usually around a foot high and depict Cthulhu in a crouching position. Following Cthulhu is said to have a worldwide doomsday cult centered in Arabia, with followers stretching everywhere in the entire world. The supposedly immortal leaders of Cthulhu's cult are said to reside in the mountains of China. This cult is nihilistic in nature and seeks to awaken the Old Ones and bring about an apocalyptic age of darkness in which, according to some stories, men would be reduced to shouting and killing each other in fits of madness. Cthulhu is also worshipped by the horrific Deep Ones and the Mi-go, other alien beings in Lovecraft's world. Cthulhu also has numerous ""star-spawn"" at his disposal; these creatures seem to share his general appearance but are much smaller and less powerful, though the nature of the ""star-spawn"" and their relationship with Cthulhu is widely unknown. He Waits Dreaming... In most of the stories, Cthulhu lays dormant deep under the ocean within the sunken city of R'lyeh, but can still influence the world via many telepathic powers and, of course, his many cults and otherworldly minions. It is said that once Cthulhu is fully awakened, he shall rise from the depths and end the world; thankfully for humanity, Cthulhu has yet to do so. However, he came close in the 1920s when a group of sailors came across his sunken city of R'lyeh, which had been brought to the surface by the alignment of the stars. They opened up one of the strange buildings, only for Cthulhu to exit it and attack them. The creature only halted its attack when the sailors used their ship to cut him in half. As they sailed away, they could see Cthulhu reforming into a whole being again. The world would have ended then but for the fact that R'lyeh suddenly sunk as the stars moved out of position. The resulting powerful current not only dragged Cthulhu into the building he had been trapped in, but also closed the door behind him, thus trapping him yet again. R'lyeh R'lyeh“ The nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh [...] was built in measureless eons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults [...] until the end. „~ H. P. Lovecraft, ""The Call of Cthulhu"". R'lyeh (pronounced /ˈɹu.li.a/ or /ɹɪl.ˈai.ɛ/) is a nightmarish supernatural city featured in the Cthulhu Mythos by author H. P. Lovecraft, which makes its first appearance in the 1928 short story "" The Call of Cthulhu "". R'lyeh is also referred to in Lovecraft's "" The Mound "" as "" Relex "". R'lyeh is a sunken city located deep under the Pacific Ocean and is where the godlike being Cthulhu of the immortal Great Old Ones is buried. R'lyeh's bizarre architecture is characterized by its non-Euclidean geometry. When R'lyeh rises in Lovecraft's short story "" The Call of Cthulhu "", the only portion of the city that emerges is a single ""hideous monolith-crowned citadel"" in which Cthulhu is entombed. The human onlookers are awed by the sheer immensity of the city and by the frightening suggestion of the gargantuan statues and bas-reliefs. The city is a panorama of ""vast angles and stone surfaces [...] too great to belong to anything right and proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and disturbing hieroglyphs"". The geometry of R'lyeh is ""abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours"". In Lovecraft's stories, R'lyeh is sometimes referred to in the ritualistic phrase ""Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn"", which roughly translates to ""In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming."". Lovecraft said that R'lyeh is located at 47°9'S 126°43'W in the southern Pacific Ocean. August Derleth, however, placed R'lyeh at 49°51'S 128°34'W in his own writings. Both locations are close to the Pacific oceanic pole of inaccessibility (48°52.6'S 123°23.6'W), the point in the ocean farthest from any land. Derleth's coordinates place the city approximately 5,100 nautical miles (5,900 statute miles or 9,500 kilometers), or about ten days journey for a fast ship, from the real island of Pohnpei (Ponape). Ponape also plays a part in the Cthulhu Mythos as the place where the ""Ponape Scripture"", a text describing Cthulhu, was found. Charles Stross's novella A Colder War implicitly locates R'lyeh in the Baltic sea, describing Cthulhu as being ""scraped from a nest in the drowned wreckage of a city on the Baltic floor."". In Nick Mamatas' novel Move Under Ground, it is located off the coast of California. Powers and Abilities While not as powerful as many other Great Old Ones and being dwarfed in scale by the Outer Gods that he serves, Cthulhu is still a very powerful entity. Being near god-like to humans, Cthulhu is immortal and has great strength and can endure great amounts of damage and can only be killed by a near-omnipotent power. Using his wings, he is capable of true flight. He possesses vast intelligence and awareness, as he knows all that is occurring in the Universe at once and he has great psychic abilities as he can communicate telepathically. Arguably Cthulhu's most notable trait is the fact that he, alongside the rest of his kin, cannot be comprehended by humans; when a human so much as looks at Cthulhu, they will almost certainly be driven mad by his visage. Cthulhu was also able to create a city out of nowhere.

P. Lovecraft“ Children will always be afraid of the dark, and men with minds sensitive to hereditary impulse will always tremble at the thought of the hidden and fathomless worlds of strange life which may pulsate in the gulfs beyond the stars, or press hideously upon our own globe in unholy dimensions which only the dead and the moonstruck can glimpse. „~ H. P. Lovecraft“ The Thing cannot be described - there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful.„~ H. P. Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulhu.“ When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. „~ H. P. Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulhu. In other fiction Cthulhu has appeared in pop culture many times: In the online videogame Adventure Quest World, popularly known as AQ, Cthulhu is a major boss called a Chaos Beast, seemingly working for Chaos Lord Iadoa, under the name Kathool, while actually having ulterior motives, and wants the player to defeat him and Iadoa, so he can achieve his goals.

However, due to localization misplacing, this enemy is originally ""Devil"" in the Japanese release of the game while the enemy ""Malachi"" is the representation of the actual Cthulhu. Due to both monsters being minor henchmen for Dracula, technically Cthulhu does not qualify as a Castlevania villain . One of the heavy metal band Metallica's popular songs in their album Ride the Lightning was a song called ""Call of Ktulu,"" obviously referencing the beast. The named is intentionally misspelled due to the belief that if anyone says Cthulhu's name verbally, he will come closer to you.

D1706570	http://www.doityourself.com/stry/how-long-does-ceramic-tile-floor-grout-take-to-dry	How Long Does Ceramic Tile Floor Grout Take to Dry?	How Long Does Ceramic Tile Floor Grout Take to Dry? When you spread grout on a ceramic tile floor, you need to make sure that you allow it plenty of time to dry before walking across it. If you step on the tiles before the grout has had a chance to fully set, you could easily ruin all your hard work. Schedule your days to set aside plenty of time for the floor to set; if the new grout is in the kitchen, plan your meals out; if it’s in a bathroom, be sure your family uses other bathrooms in the house, or arrange for alternate accommodations. Dry Time In most cases, you should allow the grout to dry overnight before using that room as total dry time may take up to 24 hours. If you are thinking about sealing your grout after you have installed it, you need to wait even longer than that so that all of the moisture has had time to be released. In most cases, this process can take as long as 72 hours to complete. Different grout mixes from different manufacturers can have their own instructions for dry times. To ensure that you always allow ample time, consult the instructions on your specific packaging and follow any directions for application to the letter. As Grout Dries It is important to note that cleaning up excess grout will actually take place while the material is still drying. Naturally, since grout is meant to be durable, clearing any grout off of your ceramic tile when it’s already dry will be difficult. So, instead, you’ll want to take a wet sponge to the grout after it sets for about 15 to 30 minutes. This should remove most of the excess, leaving only a thin haze that will have to be dealt with later. Environmental Considerations Certain factors in your home environment can cause your grout dry time to increase, the biggest of these being humidity. Since grout dries as the moisture evaporates from the material, too much moisture in the air will make it harder for the moisture to evaporate quickly. This situation will be more common in humid climate regions, but also in homes with a lot of flora indoors as plants actually release moisture into the air. Running an air conditioner or a dehumidifier in the room is the best way to dry out the air, but using a fan can also help by circulating the air across the surface of the tiles. Pull any plants you may have in the room out prior to drying the grout so they’re not negatively affected. It should also be noted that dry time should never decrease under what's directed, no matter the conditions of your home. Comments

D1732698	https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-use-everyday-metaphors-and-similes-in-your-fiction-1277707	How to Use Common Metaphors and Similes	"Fiction Writing Careers Craft & Technique How to Use Common Metaphors and Similes Share Flip Pin Share Email•••By Ginny Wiehardt Updated April 02, 2018Metaphors and similes are both what's called figurative language, or figures of speech. Metaphors and similes are literary devices used to compare one thing to another. They add understanding, dimension, and vividness to writing. Metaphors say straight up that one thing is another (""love is a flame""), deeply connecting one to the other. Similes compare one thing to another using the word ""like"" or ""as"" (""slower than molasses in January), and often are colorful sayings that are indigenous to certain regions of the country. The South is known for its abundance of memorable similes. Metaphors and similes also cut to the chase and say a lot in a few words. For example, rather than saying ""Bob is Jane's old boyfriend; they were very tight for a while, and I'm not quite sure whether there's still an attraction there,"" you can use the metaphor ""Bob is Jane's old flame."" An old flame, of course, is an old love that may or may not still burn hot. Metaphors and similes are used extensively in poetry. They are also a basic tool used in most forms of fiction writing. By comparing one thing to another, the writer can evoke a mood or memory, help the reader to make connections, establish a theme, and add interest and color to the writing. These descriptions of a sunset evoke completely different responses: No metaphor or simile: The sun was setting. The sky turned red. Then darkness fell. Both metaphor and simile: The sunset was like a glorious conflagration, blazing with fabulous colors but producing no warmth. Metaphor: The sun dipped below the horizon, the last gasp of beauty before the death of the day. Metaphors and Similes in Everyday Speech While many writers use figurative language in descriptions, it can be equally effective to put metaphorical language into characters' dialogue. Metaphors and similes are regularly used in the language people use to talk to each other, so characters need not be poets to believably use figurative language. Some metaphors and similes are used so frequently they are sometimes categorized as cliches. Some examples: Fit as a fiddle Happy as a clam She is an old flame Dull as dishwater Sharp as a tack Silent as the grave Time is money He is a pig You are my sunshine Using Common Metaphors and Similes in Your Fiction It is certainly easy to add metaphors and similes to fiction, and it's very often a good idea. But when and how you should use this language to the best effect is a question well worth asking. A cliched or mixed metaphor can sink a perfectly good story. "

The popular 44 year-old from Johannesburg, South Africa switched from Callaway to Adams during the off-season, and has decided to get ahead of the putter ruling, and back to a normal length putter. He is in Dubai at The Dubai Dessert Classic this week to help celebrate the 25th anniversary of this event, a tournament he has won three times. The “Big Easy” played well on the back nine Thursday, but found some bogeys on the front. He still looks tentative with the short putter in his hands, and looks to be trying to find some confidence on the greens. Els ran into trouble on the front side where was unable to make a birdie. He took the dreaded “six” on the final hole, a par four. He finished his day with a two over par 74 in the opening round, and is now in danger of missing the cut if he doesn’t get it together on Friday. The 2012 Open Champion is ranked 28th in the OWGR, and is currently 62nd in The Race To Dubai. He finished T37 last week at The Qatar Masters while using the short putter. Ernie Els has 26 career European Tour wins throughout his illustrious career, and 19 PGA Tour victories. He has won the US Open Twice, and the British Open twice.

This old Welsh surname is from the Welshpersonal name Rhys, which also took the forms Rice and Rees. This name was originally derived from the Old Welsh forename Ris, which means ardour. Early Origins of the Reese family The surname Reese was first found in Carmarthenshire (Welsh: Sir Gaerfyrddin), located in Southwest Wales, one of thirteen historic counties and presently one of the principal area in Wales. Sir Elidir Dhu who flourished temp. Richard I., was the direct descendant of the family of Rees of Killymaenllwyd, county Carmarthen.

""In 1115, Grufydd ab Rhys, Prince of South Wales, took sanctuary in the church of Aberdaron, from the treachery of Grufydd ab Cynan, sovereign of North Wales, who intended to deliver him into the hands of the English monarch, Henry I. The young prince escaped with his partisans by night, and set forward on his journey to the deep forest of Strath Towy, in South Wales, where, having collected the adherents of his family, he commenced hostilities against the Norman and Flemish settlers.

Reese Spelling Variations The Welsh have an extremely large amount of spelling variations of their native surnames to their credit. It was up to the priest or the scribe taking the official records to determine how the spoken name was to be made literal. As time progressed, the old Brythonic names of Wales were recorded in English, which was especially problematic since the English language had extreme difficulty recording the highly inflected sounds of Cymraeg. Spelling variations were, however, also carried out according to an individual's design: a branch loyalty within the family, a religious adherence, or even patriotic affiliations could be indicated by spelling variations of one's name. The spelling variations of the name Reese have included Rees, Reece, Rhys, Ap Rhys and others.

Migration of the Reese family to the New World and Oceana Many Welsh families joined their Scottish and Irish neighbors during the late 1800s and early 1900s in seeking refuge in North America. Like the Irish and Scottish, many Welsh anxiously awaited the work, freedom, and opportunities that they believed lay in North America. Those who did journey over to the United States and what became known as Canada often realized those dreams, but only through much toil and perseverance. Whenever and however these Welsh immigrants arrived in North America, they were instrumental in the creation of the industry, commerce, and cultural heritage within those two developing nations.

D3367552	http://www.insanityinc.us/insane0094.html	.	"Ventura Sheriff Department: A Study in Corruption First off, this is my opinion and other people's opinion may vary. I have also heard additional similiar stories about the Ventura Sheriff's department under Bob Brooks, which involved people running for political office. There is the concept of where there is smoke, there is fire. It is my personal opinion, based on what I have seen and heard, as well as the definition of the word ""corrupt"" (which involves not following the rules, not just illegal actions), that the current administration of Sheriff Bob Brooks is corrupt. It is interesting to do a web search ""ventura sheriff corrupt"". On some of the links, you will find people who believe that the Ventura Sheriff's department is corrupt and some specifically mentioned Bob Brooks and says:http://twitter.com/Ventura Corrupt Do not move to Ventura; Sheriff's Dept is corrupt and youll only get service if you are a friend of bob brooks 1:30 AM Nov 18th, 2009 from web As an introduction, do a web search for ""Ventura County Sheriff Bob Brooks fired Geoff Dean"". A link to the story is at:http://www.vcstar.com/news/2009/mar/22/brooks-is-told-to-reinstate-dean/The second paragraph in this story is really important and shows that our current government is out of control: The commission ordered Brooks to reinstate Dean and recommended that the sheriff allow his successor to be ""elected through the democratic process without undue influence from within the department,"" according to the report, which Dean provided to The Star on Friday. What is this business about the commission recommending that Sheriff Bob Brooks allow his successor to be elected without undue influence from with the department? Shouldn't Sheriff Bob Brooks be ordered to not interfear in the election process? That statement makes it clear to me that Sheriff Bob Brooks does not want to allow the citizens of Ventura County to be able to elect the best person for the office of Sheriff. While Geoff Dean was reinstated, I personally don't see how the Sheriff can be allowed to demote a person for running for Sheriff. That seems to be a clear violation of the rights of the person who want to run for office, as well as the rights of all the citizens to be able elect who they want, rather than who the current Sheriff thinks that we should elect. I recently read an article about Dennis Carpenter and Geoff Dean and their comments at a recent question and answer forum. If you read some of the articles, which are linked above, you will see that clearly Dennis Carpenter thinks that the current way of doing things should continue. Perhaps this is because he is Bob Brooks choice and he does not like the concept of the people choosing the Sheriff, instead of the previous Sheriff making the decision. Dennis Carpenter attacked Geoff Dean by saying that he was found guilty of insuboardination. In my view, that is a positive thing. Bob Brooks had NO right to tell ANYONE to not run for Sheriff until he decides that it is acceptable. Bob Brooks statements in some of the newspaper articles I have read are unethical, un American and in my opinion he should be fired and charged with a crime for interfearing in an election. Bob Brooks admitted that he transferred Geoff Dean so that he would not be seen by the public so that it harm his chance of getting elected as Sheriff. If this is not illegal, it should be. Bob Brooks' attitude seems to be quite arogant and certainly not what one would really want as an elected Sheriff. Dennis Carpenter said that he will continue to run the Sheriff's department the same as Bob Brooks. To me, this is unacceptable and shows that Dennis Carpenter should not be elected to the position of Sheriff. We don't need more of the same! !What do you think the effect is on others who might want to run for the office? I am willing to bet that others do not want to take the chance of getting fired and having to go through that whole process. It is a serious chilling effect on the democratic process. It also hints that the Ventura Sheriff's department is a rogue organization, one in which is overseen by no one. There is a reason why I made that last statement and it is because of other issues I have seen. I was told by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, who pay the salaries of the Sheriff's department, that they can not oversee nor investigate the Sheriff's department. I was told by the Ventura DA that they can not investigate unless you can prove that some illegal act occurred, which means that you had best know ALL of the laws in order to get them to do anything. Another interesting article is:http://www.vcstar.com/news/2009/mar/25/something-about-a-sheriff/Which says, in part: And he did transfer Dean out of his high-profile position as chief deputy in charge of the patrol division specifically to lower Deanâ€™s public visibility and to raise the profile of a potential competitor. Who is Sheriff Brooks to play such games? He should be fired or jailed for such actions in my opinion. His job as Sheriff is not to determine who the next Sheriff is. It is clear that his attitude is reflected in the people who he has in the power structure and it is certainly the case that he does not care to do the job of the people, he is in it for his own political goals and agenda. It is clear who Brooks wants:http://www.vcstar.com/news/2009/jul/03/chief-deputy-carpenter-begins-campaign-for/Hopefully, the people of Ventura County will vote for a change. In my case, I have seen the Ventura Sheriff's department make false statements and retaliate due to my having a valid complaint. After making an appointment, driving over an hour to get there (one way), being told that the only person the only person who does the work is out sick and that you have to come back another day (as the whole department is effectively closed), do you think it is reasonable to ask if there is anyone else who can help you? Not even the supervisor was willing to just take a thumbprint and a check. The Sheriff's department took great offense to this, but nothing was said at the time. Instead, the Sheriff's department waited until the next renewal and denied it on false grounds. How would you feel if the Sheriff's department told you that you had been fired from a job when the reality was that it was a layoff? That this had occurred around 6 years prior and was suddenly an issue, would that have an affect? How about if you told that you were guilty of misconduct on a job, when you have evidence to show that was also false? If the Ventura Sheriff's department either can't get it right or intentionally retaliates against a citizen because they don't like to be questioned, there is something seriously wrong. Then, add to that being told by Undersheriff Mark Ball that when you get answer that you don't like you should quietly walk away, making it clear that if you are so bold as to not be a sheeple that they will take action against you. Then, consider filing a complaint against these actions and have the ""Professional Standards"" Capt. Bruce Macedo investigate and not be able to find that anyone did anything wrong. What? So, the Sheriff's department can make false claims and the investigator can't find anything? Yeah, right, can you say a serious conflict of interest! !It seems clear to me that retaliation is Standard Operating Procedure with the Ventura Sheriff's department. That there is little that a citizen can do about the abuses of the Sheriff's department because they have all the power. I have to wonder how many other stories are out there about the same types of abuses. This has been educational, but I am not sure that those in power will like what I have learned. Since I have personally seen the lies from law enforcement, I really can't believe a word they have to say. This means that should I be called to serve on a Jury, I have reasonable doubt that the person that they are accusing is guilty. If the Sheriff can make up things which I personally know to be false, how can I trust them in things that I don't know? The simple answer is that I can't. It is also important to realize (see case law) that the police have no duty or obligation to protect you as an individual. This means that you are really on your own. Due to the broken government, don't expect anyone to help you unless you have large sums of money to pay to an attorney to help you. It is time to take OUR government back by throwing the current clowns out of office and electing people who are really for the people. Yes, this is a difficult task and it means that you have to follow what they are doing, but failure to do so will be the downfall of this country. Update: I recently when to a forum with Dennis Carpenter and Geoff Dean. I expected both candidates to be able to handle themselves well, but I was very mistaken. It seemed clear to me that Bob Brooks' choice for his replacement is out of his league. He had a hard time answering some questions and in one case it seemed that he was looking at his notes so as to determine what to say. He could not find anything and ended up saying that he was going to pass on that question. He could not or would not answer the question!!! Regardless of the other options, my impression was that I would not want Dennis Carpenter to be the Sheriff of Ventura County. He did not seem like a real leader to me. It also seemed to me that he was able to answer questions better when he got to hear Geoff Dean's response first. My impression is that he does not seem to be able to think for himself and that he needs others to tell him what he needs to say. Dennis Carpenter attacks Geoff Dean on his ""blemished"" record, which is bogus since it is based on Geoff Dean refusing to follow an unethical order. When Dennis Carpenter was specifically asked about whether it was ethical for the Sheriff to order people to not announce their campaign for public office and whether it was ethical for the Sheriff to transfer a person with the specific goal of harming the chances of that person to get elected, Dennis Carpenter refused to answer and said that he would continue to run the Ventura Sheriff's department the same as Bob Brooks. I guess that is an indirect answer to the question and shows that Dennis Carpenter will continue with the same abuses as Bob Brooks. I heard that one of the reasons why he refused to answer the ethics questions was that Bob Brooks was in the audience and Dennis Carpenter did not want to do anything that might upset Bob Brooks. I, personally, want a Sheriff who will speak the truth and do what is right, rather than play politics and other such games. Dennis Carpenter is supported by the Good Ol' Boys of Sheriff Bob Brooks, Undersheriff Mark Ball and the other Chief Deputies. Everyone else supports Geoff Dean it seems. "

It's available year-round and can be use alone or mixed into any number of dishes. Really versatile. Brussels Sprouts It took me a while to warm up to these little guys. But now, they are definitely at the top of my list. They cook up so tender and have a special flavor that is a bit like cabbage -- but not quite as earthy. Cabbage Cabbage is incredibly good for you. It's relatively inexpensive, and available year-round. The red variety is more nutrient-dense. Carrots Carrots are so versatile. You can use them in savory dishes like soups or sweet dishes like carrot cake. Kids and adults alike love them. They're fun to play around with in the kitchen because it's fairly difficult to ruin them by overcooking. Cauliflower I don't feel enough attention is paid to good ol' cauliflower. It's available practically everywhere and at a good price. And it makes the BEST soup, chunky or creamy. Fall in love with cauliflower!Collard, Mustard, and Turnip Greens It took me YEARS as a vegan before I attempted collard greens. Sheesh, what took me so long? Collards have a taste and texture that is a cross between spinach and kale -- and soooo good for you. Mustard and turnip greens are a little more bitter but you can offset that with a little healthy sweetener. Eat your greens!Corn on the Cob Since it's not a veggie but in fact a whole grain, you'll find it over in the Whole Grains Guide. Green Beans Surely one of the most underappreciated veggies is the green bean. But when in season and cooked up right, green beans are mouthwateringly tender with a bite. (Hey, that rhymes.) Sheer perfection. Kale OMG, if you don't love kale yet...you will! I promise. It's cheap. It's available year-round. And you can eat it alone, add it to soups or stews, make crispy potato-chip-like kale chips. Did I mention it's one of the most nutritious veggies and high in calcium? Score!Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes, and Yams Comforting. Hearty. Swoon-worthy. I don't know about you, but I love potatoes of all kinds. They're inexpensive and versatile. Did you know the ""yams"" you see in the store are not true yams, they're a variety of sweet potato. And potatoes are not even related to sweet potatoes. Who woulda thunk it? :)Spinach Spinach is one of those vegetables that we all seem to despise as kids, but somewhere along the way we fall in love. Whether wilting spinach, mixing it into another dish, or eating it raw, it's important to learn how to clean and prep this yummy and super healthy veggie. Swiss Chard I feel Swiss chard is a kinder, gentler version of kale. And it cooks up like spinach, with a delicate flavor, as far as greens go. It's easy to fall in love with Swiss chard!Squash One of THE EASIEST veggies to prepare. And the gorgeous colorful innards tell you just how incredibly good for you squash is! num-num-num Turnips Turnips are QUITE persnickety! Sort of high maintenance, but the results are outstanding if you do it right. Turnip lovers unite!WHY to eat your vegetables!After reading on and watching the video below, you're going to want to load up on your veggies. Promise. :)Vegetables are some of the most nutrient dense foods you can eat. They contain a fair amount of protein -- in fact, it's the protein which gives them their structure. They're filled with vitamins, which our bodies cannot make and must be supplied in the diet. And the dark green veggies provide calcium. In fact, even though cow's milk provides 150 mg of calcium per serving (1/2 cup), the amount absorbed is only 48 mg. Whereas bok choy, which contains 79 mg of calcium per serving (1/2 cup), the amount absorbed is 42 mg!Veggies are so beautiful and span the colors of the rainbow. These vibrant colors indicate they're chock full of phytochemicals, those disease-preventing chemicals found in all plant foods. The varying colors signify varying nutrients which is why it's important to include all the colors of the vegetable rainbow to cover the innumerable health benefits veggies bring to the table. And if you're watching your weight, it's good to know you can stuff your pie hole with tons of veggies because they're low calorie while being a healthy carb -- the kind your body uses for energy. Is It Vital To Choose Organics? It's OPTIMUM to eat organic vegetables all the time since they're grown in soil which is naturally abundant in nutrients. But let's be real, it's not always easy to find organic veggies, plus it can get expensive. So to make things easier on you, memorize these Top 5 Veggies you should ALWAYS buy organic. Why? Because they are members of ""The Dirty Dozen"", the top 12 fruits and veggies that must be purchased organic due to the amount of pesticides they contain: Celery Spinach (and other Leafy Greens like Kale and Collard Greens Sweet Bell Peppers (and Hot Peppers if you eat a lot of them! )Cucumbers Cherry Tomatoes Snap Peas (Imported)Potatoes If you can't find these organic, then don't eat them. Plain and simple. The missing five of the Dirty Dozen are the ""dirty fruits"". And on the flipside, there are ""The Clean 15"" - those fruits and veggies that contain the least amount of chemical pesticides, in case you can't afford to purchase (or don't have access to) organics: Onion Sweet Corn (technically a whole grain, organic)Asparagus Sweet Peas Cabbage Eggplant Sweet Potato Avocado (technically a fruit)Cauliflower The missing 6 are the ""clean fruits"". By the way, if you get the chance, join a local CSA group (Community Supported Agriculture), or start one up yourself. They are faaaantastic because they support your local farmers, and the prices are usually very reasonable for FRESH, ORGANIC produce! I love what Michelle from Brooklyn has to say about her experience with a CSA. Click here to locate a food co-operative or CSA near you. Here in Reno, Nevada, our gor-geous Great Basin Co-op (who ALWAYS has fresh, organic produce, most of it locally grown) has created Dropp, where you can place an order for not only fresh produce, but many other products in bulk. Place your order one day, and pick it up the next day. And if you don't have anything like this near you, start your own buying club. How Much Do You Need? Eat 4-6 servings of vegetables per day. Having a hard time imagining how you're going to eat that much food? Keep in mind a serving might be smaller than you think! One serving of cooked veggies is equal to 1/2 cup or the size of 1/2 a baseball. Refer to the Vegan Food Pyramid to learn more about serving sizes. Mix things up a bit -- snack on 1 cup of raw veggies with dip, enjoy 1 cup of cooked veggies with dinner, get in the habit of adding chopped veggies to most dishes you prepare. Once you're in the groove, you'll discover that it's actually quite simple to meet the required amount of vegetable servings per day. Another way to ensure you're getting the veggies you need is to make them the focus of at least one meal per day. Meaning, your veggie will take up the majority of room on your plate. Many times, this will mean you're eating 1 1/2 cups of veggies which is equal to 3 servings! See how easy that was? :)Juice Those Veggies!Purchase a vegetable juicer and juice those veggies! This is an excellent way to get the nutrients from a large amount of veggies. ( Here's the juicer I've had since 1997. It's a workhorse (!) and still going strong after all these years. )For instance, it takes about 5-6 carrots to make one glass of carrot juice. That's a lot of beta carotene! One 3/4 cup glass of vegetable juice equals 1 serving of vegetables. While making vegetable juices is a delicious way to meet your daily veggie quota, juicing DOES remove the all-important fiber that we need. So be sure to include a mix of fresh veggies and their juice in your daily diet. Here are some ideas for fresh vegetable juices to get you started. Feel free to experiment until you find your favorites:apple carrotapple carrot beet (my personal fave)apple carrot cucumber celery chardcarrot beetcarrot celery cabbagecarrot cucumbercarrot strawberrycarrot spinachcelery spinachspinach cabbage celeryspinach celery tomato Feel free to add foods and flavors that will help your juice to be more palatable -- especially important when juicing deep greens. Ideas: Fruits, Cranberries, Garlic, Lemon, Dill, Cayenne, and Tamari. Raw Or Cooked? Raw veggies are chock full of nutrients and are invaluable to your good health. At the same time, cooking your veggies helps to break down the cellulose walls which makes some nutrients more accessible than they'd be in their raw state. So what's the answer? Should you eat your veggies raw or cooked? Quite simply: Be sure your diet is filled with both raw AND cooked vegetables. Eat one fresh green leafy salad per day (2 cups equals 1 serving), and add chopped raw veggies such as bell peppers, onions, bok choy and grated beets. The more colorful, the better -- and the more beautiful your salad is, the more your mouth will water before your first delectable bite. As a general rule, I've always found that those veggies that seem to be lacking in lip-smacking flavor in their raw state seem to be the veggies that are best cooked first to make their nutrients more readily available. Every body is different, and the nutrients my body needs might differ slightly from those that your body needs. So listen to your body -- you'll discover which veggies you prefer cooked and which you like raw. Don't be afraid to experiment to find what works for you. The most important thing is to just get those veggies into your belly! :)Some General Rules About Vegetables Whenever possible, don't peel your veggies -- the skins contain lots of valuable nutrients;Avoid overcooking your veggies. As a general rule, veggies should be JUST tender when poked with a fork. Green veggies should be cooked just until they turn a bright and vibrant green;When making a dish with more than one veggie (recommended! ), be sure to cut them all about the same size so they cook up in the same amount of time (or close to it);To clean root vegetables, simply scrub with a brush under cold running water. Most of your veggies are best cleaned in a bowl full of cold water and an edible acid, such as lemon juice or apple cider vinegar, for 10 minutes -- this will ensure thorough cleansing. 1/4 cup of this edible acid is usually enough for a large bowl of water;Cook only the veggies you need at each meal -- leftover cooked veggies are very sad and have lost their vitality. If they look wimpy, they ARE wimpy!Whenever possible, select fresh, local, seasonal, organic veggies;Most veggies can be washed immediately upon returning from the grocery, then placed into air-tight bags or Tupperware-like containers to keep your greens and veggies fresh. When you're ready to eat, they'll be ready to go;If you own a vacuum sealer and would like to seal your vegetables for the freezer, be sure to cook them GENTLY first -- parboiling seems to work best, meaning drop cut veggies into boiling water for just a couple minutes to JUST begin the cooking process, then remove and run under cold water. Cool thoroughly, and be aware that you may have to use a large bag to allow room for water to ""seep"" towards the seal without interrupting the sealing action. Random Factoid - Raw broccoli emits a gas that will break the seal on your bags. Next: Choose A Grain To Go With Your Veggies""I do a LOT of searching online and have to say yours is probably the most informative vegan site I have come across. Actually, it is one of the most informative sites I have seen for vegetables, bar none. ""Many sites have good recipes, some have good health and nutrition info, but yours is wonderfully complete. You are very generous with the information you offer."" -- Peggy M., Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia Back to the top - How To Cook Vegetables "

Length of beam (m, ft)Force F1 (N, lb f) distance from R 1 (m, ft)Force F2 (N, lb f) distance from R 1 (m, ft)Force F3 (N, lb f) distance from R 1 (m, ft)Force F4 (N, lb f) distance from R 1 (m, ft)Force F5 (N, lb f) distance from R 1 (m, ft)Force F6 (N, lb f) distance from R 1 (m, ft)For a beam in balance loaded with weights (or other load forces) the reactions forces - R - at the supports equals the load forces - F. The force balance can be expressed as F 1+ F 2+ .... + F n= R 1+ R 2 (1)where F = force from load (N, lb f)R = force from support (N, lb f)In addition for a beam in balance the algebraic sum of moments equals zero.

D1983254	http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/state-felony-laws/states-that-allow-conjugal-visits	States that Allow Conjugal Visits	Prisoners who maintain close ties with spouses, partners, and family members are more likely to successfully reenter society upon release and less likely to commit more crime. A number of studies support this common sense conclusion. In spite of this evidence, the trend is to do away with conjugal visits. Now, only a handful of states allow them. What is A “Conjugal Visit?”Typically, a person incarcerated in jail or prison is not allowed to spend private time with a spouse or domestic partner. Historically and at present, certain states have instituted programs to allow certain prisoners to have “extended family visits.” An “extended family visit” may be an opportunity for the prisoner to spend time with his or her relatives and children, but it is also used as a euphemism for conjugal visits. A conjugal visit is private time that a prisoner may spend with a spouse or, in California, a registered domestic partner. The idea behind such visitation is to allow inmates to have intimate contact, that is, sex, with their spouses. Depending on the state’s extended family visitation program, a conjugal or extended family visit may last from as little as one hour (in Mississippi) to 48 hours (in Washington). States allowing conjugal visits recognize the benefit to the prisoner and the society at large into which the prisoner is released after serving his or her sentence. A prisoner who has maintained close family and spouse or partner relationships will have a stronger community to return to upon release, making the likelihood of successful return to society greater, and the draw of further criminal activity less powerful. Studies also show that prisoners allowed conjugal and family visits are less prone to violence and other misconduct while incarcerated. Six states allow conjugal visits In 1993, 17 states had conjugal visitation programs. That number has decreased steadily to six. Currently, only California, Connecticut, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, and Washington allow conjugal visits. Some states allow other family members, such as children and grandchildren to visit for extended periods. Washington and California even provide trailers or mobile homes on prison grounds for conjugal visits with spouses and extended family visits with other family members. All but one state restrict conjugal visits to heterosexual spouses Of the six states that do allow conjugal visits, California alone has extended the privilege to registered domestic partners of the same sex. In 2007, California followed the lead of several other countries and announced that the state would permit same sex domestic partner conjugal visits. Mexico, Brazil, Canada, and Belgium are among the countries that allow conjugal visits by same sex partners of prisoners. Connecticut permits same sex partners in civil unions to have familial visits, but only if the couple has a child as to whom each has legal parental rights, and the child is present during the visit. Unmarried Heterosexual Couple Denied Family Visits A San Quentin prisoner filed an action to force the prison to allow him to have an extended family visit with the woman and child with whom he lived prior to his imprisonment. The California Supreme Court upheld the denial of his request because the couple was not married and the prisoner was not the father of the child. In fact, the prisoner and the woman were both married to other people. While California has shown some flexibility in defining “family” member for purposes of conjugal and other visits, it was not that flexible. Conjugal Visitation Is A Privilege, Not A Right Conjugal visits are considered a privilege for prisoners who have exhibited good behavior during their term of incarceration. The U. S. Supreme Court and several federal courts have held that prisoners do not have a constitutional right to conjugal visits. Challenges based on privacy and other constitutional rights Prisoners and their spouses have filed lawsuits in several federal and state courts, arguing that denial of conjugal visits violates:the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishmentprisoner and spousal rights to marital privacythe right to procreate, andthe First Amendment right to religious freedom. Courts in these cases have rejected all of these arguments, finding no constitutional right to a conjugal visit. Following California’s adoption of a same-sex partner conjugal visitation program and the U. S. Supreme Court’s decision striking down statutes outlawing sodomy between consenting adults, it is likely that prisoners and/or partners will file challenges to heterosexual spouse-only conjugal programs. These challenges may rely upon the constitutional right to equal protection under the law. Visitation privilege is highly regulated Most states that allow conjugal visits:require that the prisoner seeking such visits have a clean prison record of good behavior and no violenceprohibit visitation for prisoners incarcerated for child abuse or domestic violence, andrestrict visits to prisoners in low- or medium-security prisons; conjugal visits are not granted to prisoners in high security facilities or on death row. Some states deny conjugal visits to inmates who have, or are at risk for, HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases. Visitor Requirements In addition to the rules governing the prisoner seeking conjugal visits, the visiting spouse or (in California) domestic partner must also meet certain standards. For example, family members must undergo a background check before being allowed a visit. Visitors may also be turned away if they are not wearing appropriate clothing. States allowing children to visit prisoners limit the areas within the facility that children may enter. And, all prison visitors (whether arriving for a conjugal or other type of visit) must submit to a physical search for weapons and other contraband. Visitors may bring very few and highly regulated items into the prison. No drugs or alcohol are ever allowed, nor are cell phones or other electronic devices. There may be other restrictions, including rules about food or gifts that may be allowed or prohibited. Most state conjugal visitation programs require that the prisoner be drug-tested after the visit. Laws Vary; Check With A Lawyer If you have questions about conjugal visitation rights in your state, consult with a lawyer experienced in the laws in your area.

Karl revealed the child was indeed quite hairy and apparently had trouble hearing due to a build up of hair in his ears. Yu was born in the city of Anshan in the Chinese province of Anshan in 1979 and began growing hair at the age of two that eventually covered approximately 96% of his body. As well as being incredibly hairy, The Hairy Chinese Kid is also an aspiring rock star and has used his unusual looks to launch something of a music career. Now he is an adult. Source2 Jesús Aceves Jesús ""Chuy"" Aceves was born in Loreto, Zacatecas, Mexico, and is the second person in his family born with a rare condition known as hypertrichosis. Chuy's face is covered with hair, making him resemble the legendary werewolf or, as some call him, a monkey man. Chuy is married and has two daughters, one of whom has the condition. In 2007, Chuy was featured in the books Ripley's Believe It or Not! and Guinness World Records. Source3 Ramos Gomez brothers Life for hairy brothers Victor ""Larry"" and Gabriel ""Danny"" Ramos Gomez is anything but dull. They fly through the air regularly in their jobs as trampoline acrobats. The duo had a chance to become TV stars when they were offered starring roles in The X-Files. Source4 Stephan Bibrowski Stephan Bibrowski (1891–1932), better known as Lionel the Lion-Faced Man, was a famous sideshow performer. His whole body was covered with long hair that gave him the appearance of a lion. Bibrowski was born in 1891 near Warsaw in Poland with one-inch hair covering his body. His mother blamed the condition on the mauling of his father by a lion, which she witnessed while pregnant with Stephan. Source5 Pruthviraj Patil Pruthviraj Patil was born to a well off farmer in the Indian district of Sangali which is near Mumbai, with the ""Werewolf Syndrome"" due to which he has all his face and body covered in thick matted hair. He and his parents have tried various traditional Ayurvedic remedies, laser surgeries and homeopathy, to cure the disease but none of them have worked. Source6 Annie Jones Annie Jones (c. 1860 – 1902) was an American bearded woman, born in Virginia. She toured with showman P. T. Barnum as a circus attraction. It is unconfirmed if this was a case of hirsutism or an unrelated genetic condition that affects children of both sexes and continues into adult years. As an adult, Jones became the country's top ""bearded lady"" and acted as a spokesperson for Barnum's ""Freaks"", a word she tried to abolish from the business. Later in her career, Jones toured in Russia and claimed to have turned down painters who asked her to pose as Jesus. She became a musician. Jones married Richard Elliot in 1881, but divorced him in 1895 for her childhood sweetheart William Donovan (who later died, leaving Jones a widow). In 1902, Jones herself died of tuberculosis. Source7 Supatra Sasuphan Supatra Sasuphan, an 13-year-old girl from Thailand, suffers from werewolf syndrome, which could offer a future cure for baldness. She has been teased her entire life by other kids, who call her ""monkey face"" and ""wolf girl"". But now her Guinness world record has made her very popular at school. She said: ""I'm very happy to be in the Guinness World Records. A lot of people have to do a lot to get in. All I did was answer a few questions and then they gave it to me."" Supatra is one of only 50 sufferers of Ambras Syndrome documented since the Middle Ages. It is caused by a faulty chromosome. Source8 Julia Pastrana Julia Pastrana (1834–25 March 1860) was a Mexican woman born with hypertrichosis who exhibited herself in 19th-century Europe. Pastrana, an indigenous Mexican, was born in 1834, somewhere in the Sierra of Sinaloa State. Her ears and nose were unusually large and her teeth were irregular. Charles Darwin described her as: ""Julia Pastrana, a Spanish dancer, was a remarkably fine woman, but she had a thick masculine beard and a hairy forehead; she was photographed, and her stuffed skin was exhibited as a show; but what concerns us is, that she had in both the upper and lower jaw an irregular double set of teeth, one row being placed within the other, of which Dr. Purland took a cast. From the redundancy of the teeth her mouth projected, and her face had a gorilla-like appearance. Source9 Percilla Bejano Percilla was born 26 April 1911 in the town of Bayamon, just south of the Puerto Rican capital of San Juan. Even as a child Percilla's hirsuteness drew attention from both the public at large and the medical community. As a baby, Percilla and her parents traveled to New York City to be examined by a team of doctors. She remained in New York for seven months before returning to Puerto Rico. Percilla passed away in 2001 at age 89.

T. Barnum from the age of 16. He also spoke Russian, German and English. Source "

Slobo's Rise To Power He's Ruined Our Lives Turbo-Nationalism Repression of the Media In Their Own Words Who is Milosevic? Slobodan Milosevic — ""Slobo"" to friends and enemies alike — joined the Communist Party when he was 18. In 1984 he became Chairman of the City Committee of the League of Communists of Belgrade. In 1986 he was elected Serbian regional Communist Party President and was re-elected in 1988. In July, 1990, the League of Communists of Serbia and the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Serbia united to form a new party: the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). Milosevic was elected President of the party, a post he formally held until his death in 2006. In 1990, Milosevic was elected to the newly created office of President of Serbia in a multi-party election. He was re-elected in December,1992. A champion of a united Yugoslavia, Milosevic saw the breakup of the Yugoslav Republic during his presidency. First, in 1991, Croatia and Slovenia declared independence. The following year, the Croats and Muslims in Bosnia seceded. During a three-year civil war, Milosevic supported Serbian rebels. However, due in part to economic crises and the impact of sanctions, in 1995, he was compelled to sign the Dayton Peace Accords, ending the civil war in Bosnia. Slobodan Milosevic and his generals Milosevic appears before the International War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague Limited to two terms as President of Serbia, Milosevic was elected President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in July, 1997. Ethnic violence continued for the next few years, mainly in the province of Kosovo. In March 1999, following increased repression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, NATO began bombing military targets in Serbia. In June, Milosevic agreed to withdraw from Kosovo, and the bombing was stopped. Although Milosevic lost the Yugoslav elections on September 24, 2000, he attempted to manipulate vote tabulations for ten days, which set off a nationwide campaign of civil disobedience and strikes culminating in the storming of Parliament ten days later. The new Serbian government under Zoran Djindjic extradited Milosevic to the Hague on June 29, 2001 to stand trial on charges of war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal of the Former Yugoslavia. Refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the court, Milosevic insisted on defending himself when his trial began in February 2002. His declining health eventually prevented him from mounting his own defense and he was appointed a legal team with whom he refused to cooperate. After long hours of testimony and numerous delays, Milosevic's trial ended prematurely when he was found dead of a heart attack in his cell on March 11, 2006.

Research > Vaginoplasty Research a cosmetic surgery procedure Vaginoplasty Vaginoplasty Vaginoplasty is a surgical proceduredesigned to rejuvenate and tighten a woman’s vagina, by removing excess lining and repairing the surrounding soft tissues. It is designed to decrease the diameter of the vagina, resulting in increased friction during intercourse to make the experience more pleasurable for both partners. Labiaplasty, a surgical procedure to beautify the outer appearance of the vagina by reducing the size and/or reshape the labia minor (“lips”), may be combined with vaginoplasty for total rejuvenation. When performed on transgendered women along with a genital reconstruction technique, this procedure is also known as a “sex change operation” or “gender reassignment surgery” (GRS). Costs of Vaginoplasty According to a sampling of surgeons who offer the procedure, the average U. S. cost of vaginoplasty can range anywhere from $3,500 to $12,000, depending on the extent of correction that is required. Combining the procedure with labiaplasty will increase the cost of vaginoplasty to the higher end of the price scale. ""The Average U.

When considering vaginoplasty, please consult a qualified provider. (To assist your search, use the physician locator. )top Benefits of Vaginoplasty For women with a large vaginal diameter, reducing the size of the opening with vaginoplasty can result in a more pleasurable intercourse experience for both partners. Patients in need of labiaplasty, which reduces the size of the vaginal lips, often report a far more comfortable intercourse experience, and a general reduction in discomfort when exercising or wearing tight clothing.top How is vaginoplasty surgery performed? ""The diameter of the vaginal openingis then reduced by minimizing the amount of vaginal lining (mucosa). ""A vaginoplasty surgeon begins with placing discreet incisions in a select location near the genitals, allowing for loose muscles to be tightened or shortened. The diameter of the vaginal opening is then reduced by minimizing the amount of vaginal lining (mucosa). Excess skin may also be removed, as can excess tissue if labiaplasty is included. Once this is completed, any incisions are closed with sutures or staples and the area is dressed.top How much pain is associated with vaginoplasty surgery?

The standard was introduced in August 1999 by joint efforts between San Disk, Panasonic (Matsushita Electric) and Toshiba as an improvement over Multi Media Cards (MMC), [1] and has become the industry standard. The three companies formed SD-3C, LLC, a company that licenses and enforces intellectual property rights associated with SD memory cards and SD host and ancillary products. [2]The companies also formed the SD Association (SDA), a non-profit organization, in January 2000 to promote and create SD Card standards. [3] SDA today has about 1,000 member companies. The SDA uses several trademarked logos owned and licensed by SD-3C to enforce compliance with its specifications and assure users of compatibility.

The four families are the original Standard-Capacity (SDSC), the High-Capacity (SDHC), the e Xtended-Capacity ( SDXC ), and the SDIO, which combines input/output functions with data storage. [5] [6] [7] The three form factors are the original size, the mini size, and the micro size. Electrically passive adapters allow a smaller card to fit and function in a device built for a larger card. The SD card's small footprint is an ideal storage medium for smaller, thinner and more portable electronic devices. SD (SDSC) [ edit]This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (October 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)The second-generation Secure Digital (SDSC or Secure Digital Standard Capacity) card was developed to improve on the Multi Media Card (MMC) standard, which continued to evolve, but in a different direction. Secure Digital changed the MMC design in several ways: Asymmetrical shape of the sides of the SD card prevent inserting it upside down (while an MMC goes in most of the way but makes no contact if inverted). Most SD cards are 2.1 mm (0.083 inches) thick, compared to 1.4 mm (0.055 inches) for MMCs. The SD specification defines a card called Thin SD with a thickness of 1.4 mm, but they occur only rarely, as the SDA went on to define even smaller form factors. The card's electrical contacts are recessed beneath the surface of the card, protecting them from contact with a user's fingers. The SD specification envisioned capacities and transfer rates exceeding those of MMC, and both of these functionalities have grown over time. For a comparison table, see below. While MMC uses a single pin for data transfers, the SD card added a four-wire bus mode for higher data rates. The SD card added Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM) security circuitry for digital rights management (DRM) content-protection. Addition of a write-protect notch Full-size SD cards do not fit into the slimmer MMC slots, and other issues also affect the ability to use one format in a host device designed for the other. SDHC [ edit]Official SDHC logo The Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) format, announced in January 2006 and defined in version 2.0 of the SD specification, supports cards with capacities up to 32 GB. [5] The SDHC trademark is licensed to ensure compatibility. [8]SDHC cards are physically and electrically identical to standard-capacity SD cards (SDSC). The major compatibility issues between SDHC and SDSC cards are the redefinition of the Card-Specific Data (CSD) register in version 2.0 (see below ), and the fact that SDHC cards are shipped preformatted with the FAT32 file system. Version 2.0 also introduces a High-speed bus mode for both SDSC and SDHC cards, which doubles the original Standard Speed clock to produce 25 MB/s. [9]SDHC host devices are required to accept older SD cards. [10] However, older host devices do not recognize SDHC or SDXC memory cards, although some devices can do so through a firmware upgrade. [11] Older Windows operating systems released before Windows 7 require patches or service packs to support access to SDHC cards. [12] [13] [14]SDXC [ edit]Official SDXC logo The Secure Digital e Xtended Capacity (SDXC) format, announced in January 2009 and defined in version 3.01 of the SD specification, supports cards up to 2 TB (2048 GB), compared to a limit of 32 GB for SDHC cards in the SD 2.0 specification. SDXC adopts Microsoft's ex FAT file system as a mandatory feature. [15]Version 3.01 also introduced the Ultra High Speed (UHS) bus for both SDHC and SDXC cards, with interface speeds from 50 MByte/s to 104 MByte/s for four-bit UHS-I bus. [16]Version 4.0, introduced in June 2011, allows speeds of 156 MByte/s to 312 MByte/s over the four-lane (two differential lanes) UHS-II bus, which requires an additional row of physical pins. [16]Version 5.0 was announced in February 2016 at CP+ 2016, and added ""Video Speed Class"" ratings for UHS cards to handle higher resolution video formats like 8K. [17] [18] The new ratings define a minimum write speed of 90 MB/s. [19] [20]ex FAT filesystem [ edit]Main article: ex FATThis section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (October 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)SDXC cards utilize the ex FAT file system, the use of which is governed by a proprietary license, thereby limiting its legal availability to a small set of operating systems. Therefore, ex FAT-formatted SDXC cards are not a universally readable exchange medium. Windows Vista (SP1) and later [21] and OS X (10.6.5 and later) support ex FAT out of the box. [22] [23] (Windows XP and Server 2003 can support ex FAT via an optional update from Microsoft.) [24] Most BSD and Linux distributions do not, for legal reasons; users must manually install third-party implementations of ex FAT (as a FUSE module) in order to be able to mount ex FAT-formatted volumes. [25] However, SDXC cards can be reformatted to use any file system (such as ext2, UFS, or VFAT ), alleviating the restrictions associated with ex FAT availability. Nevertheless, in order to be fully compliant with the SDXC card specification, many SDXC-capable host devices are firmware-programmed to expect ex FAT on cards larger than 32 GB [ citation needed]. Consequently, they may not accept SDXC cards reformatted as FAT32, even if the device supports FAT32 on smaller cards (for SDHC compatibility). Therefore, even if a file system is supported in general, it is not always possible to use alternative file systems on SDXC cards at all depending on how strictly the SDXC card specification has been implemented in the host device. This bears a risk of accidental loss of data, as a host device may treat a card with an unrecognized file system as blank or damaged and reformat the card. The SD Association provides a formatting utility for Windows and Mac OS X that checks and formats SD, SDHC, and SDXC cards. [26]Ultra High Speed (UHS) bus [ edit]Back side of a Lexar UHS-II micro SDHC card, showing the additional row of UHS-II connections The Ultra High Speed (UHS) bus is available on some SDHC and SDXC cards. [27] [28] [29] The following ultra-high speeds are specified: UHS-ISpecified in SD version 3.01, [30] supports a clock frequency of 100 MHz (a quadrupling of the original ""Default Speed""), which in four-bit transfer mode could transfer 50 MB/s (SDR50). UHS-I cards declared as UHS104 (SDR104) also support a clock frequency of 208 MHz, which could transfer 104 MB/s. Double data rate operation at 50 MHz (DDR50) is also specified in Version 3.01, and is mandatory for micro SDHC and micro SDXC cards labeled as UHS-I. In this mode, four bits are transferred when the clock signal rises and another four bits when it falls, transferring an entire byte on each full clock cycle, hence a 50 MB/s operation could be transferred using a 50 MHz clock. UHS-IISD card reader Specified in version 4.0, further raises the data transfer rate to a theoretical maximum of 156 MB/s (full duplex) or 312 MB/s (half duplex) using an additional row of pins [31] [32] (a total of 17 pins for full-size and 16 pins for micro-size cards). [27]UHS-IIIVersion 6.0, released in February 2017, added two new data rates to the standard. FD312 provides 312 MB/s while FD624 doubles that. Both are full-duplex. The physical interface and pin-layout are the same as with UHS-II, retaining backward compatibility. [33]Cards that comply with UHS show Roman numerals 'I', 'II' or 'III' next to the SD card logo, [27] [34] and report this capability to the host device. Use of UHS-I requires that the host device command the card to drop from 3.3-volt to 1.8-volt operation over the I/O interface pins and select the four-bit transfer mode, while UHS-II requires 0.4-volt operation. The higher speed rates are achieved by using a two-lane low voltage (0.4 V pp) differential interface. Each lane is capable of transferring up to 156 MB/s. In full duplex mode, one lane is used for Transmit while the other is used for Receive. In half duplex mode both lanes are used for the same direction of data transfer allowing a double data rate at the same clock speed. In addition to enabling higher data rates, the UHS-II interface allows for lower interface power consumption, lower I/O voltage and lower electromagnetic interference (EMI). Speeds [ edit]SD card speed is customarily rated by its sequential read or write speed. The sequential performance aspect is the most relevant for storing and retrieving large files (relative to block sizes internal to the flash memory ), such as images and multimedia. Small data (such as file names, sizes and timestamps) falls under the much lower speed limit of random access, which can be the limiting factor in some use cases. [35] [36] [37]With early SD cards, a few card manufacturers specified the speed as a ""times"" (""×"") rating, which compared the average speed of reading data to that of the original CD-ROM drive. This was superseded by the Speed Class Rating, which guarantees a minimum rate at which data can be written to the card. [34]The newer families of SD card improve card speed by increasing the bus rate (the frequency of the clock signal that strobes information into and out of the card). Whatever the bus rate, the card can signal to the host that it is ""busy"" until a read or a write operation is complete. Compliance with a higher speed rating is a guarantee that the card limits its use of the ""busy"" indication.

The specification defines these classes in terms of performance curves that translate into the following minimum read-write performance levels on an empty card and suitability for different applications: [30] [34] [40] [41]Front side of a 32GB Lexar 1000x Micro SDHC UHS-II class U3Minimum sequential writing speed Speed Class UHS Speed Class Video Speed Class Application2 MB/s Class 2 (C2) - - SD video recording4 MB/s Class 4 (C4) - -High-definition video (HD) recording including Full HD (from 720p to 1080p/1080i)6 MB/s Class 6 (C6) - Class 6 (V6)10 MB/s Class 10 (C10) Class 1 (U1) Class 10 (V10) Full HD (1080p) video recording and consecutive recording of HD stills (High Speed bus, Class C10), real-time broadcasts and large HD video files (UHS bus, Classes U1 and V10)30 MB/s - Class 3 (U3) Class 30 (V30) 1080p and 4K video files at 60/120 fps (UHS bus)60 MB/s - - Class 60 (V60)8K video files at 60/120 fps (UHS bus)90 MB/s - - Class 90 (V90)Application Performance Class Minimum sustained sequential writing speed Minimum random read Minimum random write Class 1 (A1) 10 MB/s 1500 IOPS 500 IOPSClass 2 (A2) 4000 IOPS 2000 IOPSSpeed classes 2, 4, and 6 assert that the card supports the respective number of megabytes per second as a minimum sustained write speed for a card in a fragmented state. Class 10 asserts that the card supports 10 MB/s as a minimum non-fragmented sequential write speed and uses a High Speed bus mode. [30] The host device can read a card's speed class and warn the user if the card reports a speed class that falls below an application's minimum need. [30] By comparison, the older ""×"" rating measured maximum speed under ideal conditions, and was vague as to whether this was read speed or write speed. The graphical symbol for the speed class has a number encircled with 'C' (C2, C4, C6, and C10). UHS-I and UHS-II cards can use UHS Speed Class rating with two possible grades: class 1 for minimum read/write performance of at least 10 MB/s ('U1' symbol featuring number 1 inside 'U') and class 3 for minimum write performance of 30 MB/s ('U3' symbol featuring 3 inside 'U'), targeted at recording 4K video. [42] Before November 2013, the rating was branded UHS Speed Grade and contained grades 0 (no symbol) and 1 ('U1' symbol). Manufacturers can also display standard speed class symbols (C2, C4, C6, and C10) alongside, or in place of UHS speed class. Video Speed Class defines a set of requirements for UHS cards to match the modern MLC NAND flash memory [19] and supports progressive 4K and 8K video with minimum sequential writing speeds of 6-90 MB/s. [17] [34] [40] The graphical symbols use 'V' followed by a number designating write speed (V6, V10, V30, V60, and V90). Application Performance Class is a newly defined standard from the SD Specification 5.1 and 6.0 which not only define sequential Reading Speeds but also mandates a minimum IOPS for reading and writing. Class A1 requires a minimum of 1500 reading and 500 writing operations per second, while class A2 requires 4000 and 2000 IOPS. [43]UHS memory cards work best with UHS host devices. The combination lets the user record HD resolution videos with tapeless camcorders while performing other functions. It is also suitable for real-time broadcasts and capturing large HD videos. The most important advice [ according to whom?] to consumers is to continue to match SD card purchases to an application's recommended speed class. Applications that require a specific speed class usually specify this in their user manuals. ""×"" rating [ edit]Rating Approx. (MB/s) Comparable Speed Class16× 2.34 (13×)32× 4.69 (27×)48× 7.03 (40×)100× 14.6 (67×)Main article: CD and DVD writing speed The ""×"" rating, that was used by some card manufacturers and made obsolete by speed classes, is a multiple of the standard CD-ROM drive speed of 150 Ki B/s (approximately 1.23 Mbit/s ). Basic cards transfer data at up to six times (6×) the CD-ROM speed; that is, 900 Ki B/s or 7.37 Mbit/s. The 2.0 specification [ clarification needed] defines speeds up to 200×, but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed. Manufacturers may report best-case speeds and may report the card's fastest read speed, which is typically faster than the write speed. Some vendors, including Transcend and Kingston, report their cards' write speed. [44] When a card lists both a speed class and an ""×"" rating, the latter may be assumed a read speed only. Real-world performance [ edit]In applications that require sustained write throughput, such as video recording, the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card's class rating falls below a particular speed. For example, a high-definition camcorder may require a card of not less than Class 6, suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used. Digital cameras with slow cards may take a noticeable time after taking a photograph before being ready for the next, while the camera writes the first picture. The speed class rating does not totally characterize card performance. Different cards of the same class may vary considerably while meeting class specifications. A card's speed depends on many factors, including: The frequency of soft errors that the card's controller must re-try Write amplification: The flash controller may need to overwrite more data than requested. This has to do with performing read-modify-write operations on write blocks, freeing up (the much larger) erase blocks, while moving data around to achieve wear leveling. File fragmentation: where there is not sufficient space for a file to be recorded in a contiguous region, it is split into non-contiguous fragments. This does not cause rotational or head-movement delays as with electromechanical hard drives, but may decrease speed; for instance, by requiring additional reads and computation to determine where on the card the file's next fragment is stored. In addition, speed may vary markedly between writing a large amount of data to a single file ( sequential access, as when a digital camera records large photographs or videos) and writing a large number of small files (a random-access use common in smartphones ). A study in 2012 found that, in this random-access use, some Class 2 cards achieved a write speed of 1.38 MB/s, while all cards tested of Class 6 or greater (and some of lower Classes; lower Class does not necessarily mean better small-file performance), including those from major manufacturers, were over 100 times slower. [35] In 2014, a blogger measured a 300-fold performance difference on small writes; this time, the best card in this category was a class 4 card.

(October 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)Unlocked and locked SD cards The user can designate most full-size SD cards as read-only by use of a sliding tab that covers a notch in the card. The mini SD and micro SD formats do not support a write protection notch. When looking at the SD card from the top, the right side (the side with the beveled corner) must be notched. On the left side, there may be a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is read-only. If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or downward to declare it read-only. The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding write-protect tab in both the unlocked and locked positions. The presence of a notch, and the presence and position of a tab, have no effect on the SD card's operation. A host device that supports write protection should refuse to write to an SD card that is designated read-only in this way. Some host devices do not support write protection, which is an optional feature of the SD specification. Drivers and devices that do obey a read-only indication may give the user a way to override it. Cards sold with content that must not be altered are permanently marked read-only by having a notch and no sliding tab. Card password [ edit]This section does not cite any sources.

(October 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)Micro SD to SD adapter (left), micro SD to mini SD adapter (middle), micro SD card (right)A host device can lock an SD card using a password of up to 16 bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands to read and write data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but there is no way to gain access to the existing data. Windows Phone 8 devices use SD cards designed for access only by the phone manufacturer or mobile provider. An SD card inserted into the phone underneath the battery compartment becomes locked ""to the phone with an automatically generated key"" so that ""the SD card cannot be read by another phone, device, or PC"". [45] Symbian devices, however, are some of the few that can perform the necessary low-level format operations on locked SD cards. It is therefore possible to use a device such as the Nokia N8 to reformat the card for subsequent use in other devices. [46]smart SD cards [ edit]A smart SD memory card is a micro SD card with an internal ""secure element"" that allows the transfer of ISO 7816 Application Protocol Data Unit commands to, for example, Java Card applets running on the internal secure element through the SD bus. [47]Various implementations of smart SD cards have been done for payment applications and secured authentication. [48] [49]micro SD cards with Secure Element and NFC ( near field communication) support are used for payment and secure access. [50] [51]Vendor enhancements [ edit]SD cards with dual interfaces: SD and USBVendors have sought to differentiate their products in the market through various vendor-specific features: Integrated Wi-Fi – Several companies produce SD cards with built-in Wi-Fi transceivers supporting static security (WEP 40; 104; and 128, WPA-PSK, and WPA2-PSK). The card lets any digital camera with an SD slot transmit captured images over a wireless network, or store the images on the card's memory until it is in range of a wireless network. Examples include: Eye-Fi / San Disk, Transcend Wi-Fi, Toshiba Flash Air, Trek Flucard, PQI Air Card and LZeal ez Share. [52] Some models geotag their pictures. Pre-loaded content – In 2006, San Disk announced Gruvi, a micro SD card with extra digital rights management features, which they intended as a medium for publishing content. San Disk again announced pre-loaded cards in 2008, under the slot Music name, this time not using any of the DRM capabilities of the SD card. [53] In 2011, San Disk offered various collections of 1000 songs on a single slot Music card for about $40, [54] now restricted to compatible devices and without the ability to copy the files. Integrated USB connector – The San Disk SD Plus product can be plugged directly into a USB port without needing a USB card reader. [55] Other companies introduced comparable products, such as the Duo SD product of OCZ Technology and the 3 Way (micro SDHC, SDHC, and USB) product of A-DATA, which was available in 2008 only. Different colors – San Disk has used various colors of plastic or adhesive label, including a ""gaming"" line in translucent plastic colors that indicated the card's capacity. Integrated display – In 2006, A-DATA announced a Super Info SD card with a digital display that provided a two-character label and showed the amount of unused memory on the card. [56]SDIO cards [ edit]This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (October 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)Camera using the SDIO interface to connect to some HP i PAQ devices A SDIO (Secure Digital Input Output) card is an extension of the SD specification to cover I/O functions. SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the Palm Treo, but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support GPS receivers, modems, barcode readers, FM radio tuners, TV tuners, RFID readers, digital cameras, and interfaces to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, and Ir DA. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface. SDIO cards support most of the memory commands of SD cards. SDIO cards can be structured as eight logical cards, although currently, the typical way that an SDIO card uses this capability is to structure itself as one I/O card and one memory card. The SDIO and SD interfaces are mechanically and electrically identical. Host devices built for SDIO cards generally accept SD memory cards without I/O functions. However, the reverse is not true, because host devices need suitable drivers and applications to support the card's I/O functions. For example, an HP SDIO camera usually does not work with PDAs that do not list it as an accessory. Inserting an SDIO card into any SD slot causes no physical damage nor disruption to the host device, but users may be frustrated that the SDIO card does not function fully when inserted into a seemingly compatible slot. (USB and Bluetooth devices exhibit comparable compatibility issues, although to a lesser extent thanks to standardized USB device classes and Bluetooth profiles . )The SDIO family comprises Low-Speed and Full-Speed cards. Both types of SDIO cards support SPI and one-bit SD bus types. Low-Speed SDIO cards are allowed to also support the four-bit SD bus; Full-Speed SDIO cards are required to support the four-bit SD bus. To use an SDIO card as a ""combo card"" (for both memory and I/O), the host device must first select four-bit SD bus operation. Two other unique features of Low-Speed SDIO are a maximum clock rate of 400 k Hz for all communications, and the use of Pin 8 as ""interrupt"" to try to initiate dialogue with the host device. [57]Ganging cards together The one-bit SD protocol was derived from the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use open collector interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a pull-up resistor) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own chip select line to sense that the host device had selected it. [ citation needed]The SD protocol envisioned the ability to gang 30 cards together without separate chip select lines. The host device would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card to respond to the command using its unique serial number. [ citation needed]In practice, cards are rarely ganged together because open-collector operation has problems at high speeds and increases power consumption. Newer versions of the SD specification recommend separate lines to each card. [ citation needed]Compatibility [ edit]Host devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide backward compatibility and accept older SD cards. [10] For example, SDXC host devices accept all previous families of SD memory cards, and SDHC host devices also accept standard SD cards. Older host devices generally do not support newer card formats, and even when they might support the bus interface used by the card, [6] there are several factors that arise: A newer card may offer greater capacity than the host device can handle (over 4 GB for SDHC, over 32 GB for SDXC). A newer card may use a file system the host device cannot navigate ( FAT32 for SDHC, ex FAT for SDXC)Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides. The hardware interface of the card was changed starting with the version 2.0 (new high-speed bus clocks, redefinition of storage capacity bits) and SDHC family (Ultra-high speed (UHS) bus)UHS-II has physically more pins but is backwards compatible to UHS-I and non-UHS for both slot and card. [27]Some vendors produced SDSC cards above 1GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so.

Beneath it is a section of a magnetic-core memory (used until the 1970s) that holds eight bytes using 64 cores. The card covers approximately 20 bits (2 1/2 bytes) This SD card's storage is approximately 3.5 billion times greater areal density. In 1999, San Disk, Matsushita, and Toshiba agreed to develop and market the Secure Digital (SD) Memory Card. [58] The card was derived from the Multi Media Card (MMC) and provided digital rights management based on the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) standard and for the time, a high memory density. It was designed to compete with the Memory Stick, a DRM product that Sony had released the year before. Developers predicted that DRM would induce wide use by music suppliers concerned about piracy. [59]The trademarked SD logo was originally developed for the Super Density Disc, which was the unsuccessful Toshiba entry in the DVD format war. For this reason the D within the logo resembles an optical disc. At the 2000 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) trade show, the three companies announced the creation of the SD Association (SDA) to promote SD cards. The SD Association, headquartered in San Ramon, California, United States, started with about 30 companies and today consists of about 1,000 product manufacturers that make interoperable memory cards and devices. Early samples of the SD Card became available in the first quarter of 2000, with production quantities of 32 and 64 MB cards available three months later. Mini- and micro-cards [ edit]The mini SD form was introduced at March 2003 Ce BIT by San Disk Corporation which announced and demonstrated it. [60] The SDA adopted the mini SD card in 2003 as a small form factor extension to the SD card standard. While the new cards were designed especially for mobile phones, they are usually packaged with a mini SD adapter that provides compatibility with a standard SD memory card slot. In September 2006, San Disk announced the 4 GB mini SDHC. [61] Like the SD and SDHC, the mini SDHC card has the same form factor as the older mini SD card but the HC card requires HC support built into the host device. Devices that support mini SDHC work with mini SD and mini SDHC, but devices without specific support for mini SDHC work only with the older mini SD card. Since 2008, mini SD cards were no longer produced. The micro SD removable miniaturized Secure Digital flash memory cards were originally named T-Flash or TF, abbreviations of Trans Flash. Trans Flash and micro SD cards are functionally identical allowing either to operate in devices made for the other. [62] San Disk had conceived micro SD when its chief technology officer and the chief technology officer of Motorola concluded that current memory cards were too large for mobile phones. The card was originally called T-Flash, but just before product launch, T-Mobile sent a cease-and-desist order to San Disk claiming that T-Mobile owned the trademark on T- (anything), [ citation needed] and the name was changed to Trans Flash. At CTIA Wireless 2005, the SDA announced the small micro SD form factor along with SDHC secure digital high capacity formatting in excess of 2 GB with a minimum sustained read and write speed of 17.6 Mbit/s. San Disk induced the SDA to administer the micro SD standard. The SDA approved the final micro SD specification on July 13, 2005. Initially, micro SD cards were available in capacities of 32, 64, and 128 MB. The Motorola E398 was the first mobile phone to contain a Trans Flash (later micro SD) card. A few years later, their competitors began using micro SD cards. SDIO, SDHC, and SDXC [ edit]In April 2006, the SDA released a detailed specification for the non-security related parts of the SD memory card standard and for the Secure Digital Input Output (SDIO) cards and the standard SD host controller. [ citation needed]The SDHC format, announced in January 2006, brought improvements such as 32 GB storage capacity and mandatory support for FAT32 filesystems. [ citation needed]In January 2009, the SDA announced the SDXC family, which supports cards up to 2 TB and speeds up to 300 MB/s. [ citation needed] It features mandatory support for the ex FAT filesystem. [ citation needed]SDXC was announced at Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2009 (January 7–10, 2009). At the same show, San Disk and Sony also announced a comparable Memory Stick XC variant with the same 2 TB maximum as SDXC, [63] and Panasonic announced plans to produce 64 GB SDXC cards. [64]On March 6, 2009, Pretec introduced the first SDXC card, [65] a 32 GB card with a read/write speed of 400 Mbit/s. But only early in 2010 did compatible host devices come onto the market, including Sony 's Handycam HDR-CX55V camcorder, Canon 's EOS 550D (also known as Rebel T2i) Digital SLR camera, [66] a USB card reader from Panasonic, and an integrated SDXC card reader from JMicron. [67] The earliest laptops to integrate SDXC card readers relied on a USB 2.0 bus, which does not have the bandwidth to support SDXC at full speed. [68]Also in early 2010, commercial SDXC cards appeared from Toshiba (64 GB), [69] [70] Panasonic (64 GB and 48 GB), [71] and San Disk (64 GB). [72] In early 2011, Centon Electronics, Inc. (64 GB and 128 GB) and Lexar (128 GB) began shipping SDXC cards rated at Speed Class 10. [73] Pretec offered cards from 8 GB to 128 GB rated at Speed Class 16. [74]In September 2011, San Disk released a 64 GB micro SDXC card. [75] Kingmax released a comparable product in 2011. [76]In late 2012, Lexar released the first 256 GB SDXC card, based on 20 nm NAND flash technology. [77]In April 2012, Panasonic introduced Micro P2 card format for professional video applications. The cards are essentially full-size SDHC or SDXC UHS-II cards, rated at UHS Speed Class U1. [78] [79] An adapter allows Micro P2 cards to work in current P2 card equipment. [80] Panasonic Micro P2 cards shipped in March 2013 and were the first UHS-II compliant products on market; initial offer includes a 32GB SDHC card and a 64GB SDXC card. [78] [81]In February 2014, San Disk introduced the first 128 GB micro SDXC card, [82] which was followed by a 200 GB micro SDXC card in March 2015. [83] September 2014 saw San Disk announce the first 512 GB SDXC card. [84]Samsung announced the world's first EVO Plus 256 GB micro SDXC card in May 2016. [85] and in September 2016 Western Digital announced that a prototype of the first 1 TB SDXC card will be demonstrated at Photokina. [86]In August 2017, San Disk launched a 400 GB micro SDXC card. [87]Markets [ edit]Secure Digital cards are used in many consumer electronic devices, and have become a widespread means of storing several gigabytes of data in a small size. [ citation needed] Devices in which the user may remove and replace cards often, such as digital cameras, camcorders, and video game consoles, tend to use full-sized cards. [ citation needed] Devices in which small size is paramount, such as mobile phones, tend to use micro SD cards. [ citation needed]The micro SD card has helped propel the smartphone market by giving both manufacturers and consumers greater flexibility and freedom. [ according to whom?] Due to their compact size, micro SD cards are used in many [ which?] different applications in a large variety [ which?] of markets. Action cameras, such as the Go PRO's Hero and cameras in drones, frequently use micro SD cards. [ citation needed]Latest versions of major operating systems, including Windows Mobile and Android Marshmallow, allow applications to run from micro SD cards creating possibilities for new usage models for SD cards in mobile computing markets. [88]SD cards are not the most economical solution in devices that need only a small amount of non-volatile memory, such as station presets in small radios. They may also not present the best choice for applications that require higher storage capacities or speeds as provided by other flash card standards such as Compact Flash. These limitations may be addressed by evolving memory technologies, such as the world's highest capacity San Disk Ultra 200GB micro SD released in 2015. [89]Samsung Pro 64 GB micro SDXC original (left) and counterfeit (right): The counterfeit claims to have 64 GB in capacity, but only 8 GB (Class 4 speed) are usable: When trying to write more than 8 GB, data loss occurs. Also used for San Disk 64 GB fakes. Many personal computers of all types, including tablets and mobile phones, use SD cards, either through built-in slots or through an active electronic adapter. Adapters exist for the PC card, Express Bus, USB, Fire Wire, and the parallel printer port. Active adapters also let SD cards be used in devices designed for other formats, such as Compact Flash. The Flash Path adapter lets SD cards be used in a floppy disk drive. Counterfeits [ edit]Images of genuine, questionable, and fake/counterfeit micro SD (Secure Digital) cards before and after decapsulation. Details at source, photo by Andrew Huang.

(October 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)SD/MMC cards replaced Toshiba 's Smart Media as the dominant memory card format used in digital cameras. In 2001, Smart Media had achieved nearly 50% use, but, by 2005, SD/MMC had achieved over 40% of the digital camera market and Smart Media's share had plummeted by 2007. At this time, all the leading digital camera manufacturers used SD in their consumer product lines, including Canon, Casio, Fujifilm, Kodak, Leica, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Pentax, Ricoh, Samsung, and Sony. Formerly, Olympus and Fujifilm used XD-Picture Cards (x D cards) exclusively, while Sony only used Memory Stick; by early 2010 all three supported SD. Some prosumer and professional digital cameras continued to offer Compact Flash (CF), either on a second card slot or as the only storage, as CF supports much higher maximum capacities and historically was cheaper for the same capacity. Secure Digital memory cards can be used in Sony XDCAM EX camcorders with an adapter [95] and in Panasonic P2 card equipment with a Micro P2 adapter. Personal computers [ edit]Although many personal computers accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device using a built-in slot, or can accommodate SD cards by means of a USB adapter, SD cards cannot be used as the primary hard disk through the onboard ATA controller, because none of the SD card variants support ATA signalling. Primary hard disk use requires a separate SD controller chip [96] or an SD-to-Compact Flash converter. However, on computers that support bootstrapping from a USB interface, an SD card in a USB adapter can be the primary hard disk, provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete. Since late 2009, newer Apple computers with installed SD card readers have been able to boot in mac OS from SD storage devices, when properly formatted to Mac OS Extended file format and the default partition table set to GUID Partition Table. [97] (See Other file systems below). Embedded systems [ edit]A shield ( daughterboard) that gives Arduino prototyping microprocessors access to SD cards In 2008, the SDA specified Embedded SD, ""leverag [ing] well-known SD standards"" to enable non-removable SD-style devices on printed circuit boards. [98] However this standard was not adopted by the market while the MMC standard became the de facto standard for embedded systems. San Disk provides such embedded memory components under the i NAND brand. [99]Most modern microcontrollers have built-in SPI logic that can interface to an SD card operating in its SPI mode, providing non-volatile storage. Even if a microcontroller lacks the SPI feature, the feature can be emulated by bit banging. For example, a home-brew hack combines spare General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins of the processor of the Linksys WRT54G router with MMC support code from the Linux kernel. [100] This technique can achieve throughput of up to 1.6 Mbit/s. Technical details [ edit]Physical size [ edit]The SD card specification defines three physical sizes. The SD and SDHC families are available in all three sizes, but the SDXC family is not available in the mini size, and the SDIO family is not available in the micro size. Smaller cards are usable in larger slots through use of a passive adapter.

The SPI bus mode and one-bit SD bus mode are mandatory for all SD families, as explained in the next section. Once the host device and the SD card negotiate a bus interface mode, the usage of the numbered pins is the same for all card sizes. SPI bus mode: Serial Peripheral Interface Bus is primarily used by embedded microcontrollers. This bus type supports only a 3.3-volt interface. This is the only bus type that does not require a host license. One-bit SD bus mode: Separate command and data channels and a proprietary transfer format. Four-bit SD bus mode: Uses extra pins plus some reassigned pins. This is the same protocol as the one-bit SD bus mode which uses one command and four data lines for faster data transfer. All SD cards support this mode. UHS-I and UHS-II require this bus type. Two differential lines SD UHS-II mode: Uses two low-voltage differential interfaces to transfer commands and data. UHS-II cards include this interface in addition to the SD bus modes. The physical interface comprises 9 pins, except that the mini SD card adds two unconnected pins in the center and the micro SD card omits one of the two V SS (Ground) pins. [102]Official pin numbers for each card type (top to bottom): MMC, SD, mini SD, micro SD. This shows the evolution from the older MMC, on which SD is based.

Interface [ edit]Inside a 512 MB SD card: NAND flash chip that holds the data (bottom) and SD controller (top)Inside a 2 GB SD card: two NAND flash chips (top and middle), SD controller chip (bottom)Inside a 16 GB SDHC card Command interface [ edit]SD cards and host devices initially communicate through a synchronous one-bit interface, where the host device provides a clock signal that strobes single bits in and out of the SD card. The host device thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can signal that a response will be delayed, but the host device can abort the dialogue. [30]Through issuing various commands, the host device can: [30]Determine the type, memory capacity, and capabilities of the SD card Command the card to use a different voltage, different clock speed, or advanced electrical interface Prepare the card to receive a block to write to the flash memory, or read and reply with the contents of a specified block. The command interface is an extension of the Multi Media Card (MMC) interface. SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol, but added commands related to copy protection. By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted, a host device can accommodate both SD and MMC cards. Electrical interface [ edit]All SD card families initially use a 3.3 volt electrical interface. On command, SDHC and SDXC cards can switch to 1.8 V operation. [30]At initial power-up or card insertion, the host device selects either the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus or the one-bit SD bus by the voltage level present on Pin 1. Thereafter, the host device may issue a command to switch to the four-bit SD bus interface, if the SD card supports it. For various card types, support for the four-bit SD bus is either optional or mandatory. [30]After determining that the SD card supports it, the host device can also command the SD card to switch to a higher transfer speed. Until determining the card's capabilities, the host device should not use a clock speed faster than 400 k Hz. SD cards other than SDIO (see below) have a ""Default Speed"" clock rate of 25 MHz. The host device is not required to use the maximum clock speed that the card supports. It may operate at less than the maximum clock speed to conserve power. [30] Between commands, the host device can stop the clock entirely. Achieving higher card speeds [ edit]The SD specification defines four-bit-wide transfers. (The MMC specification supports this and also defines an eight-bit-wide mode; MMC cards with extended bits were not accepted by the market.) Transferring several bits on each clock pulse improves the card speed. Advanced SD families have also improved speed by offering faster clock frequencies and double data rate (explained here) in a high-speed differential interface (UHS-II). [ citation needed]File system [ edit]Like other types of flash memory card, an SD card of any SD family is a block-addressable storage device, in which the host device can read or write fixed-size blocks by specifying their block number. [ citation needed]MBR and FAT [ edit]Most SD cards ship preformatted with one or more MBR partitions, where the first or only partition contains a file system. This lets them operate like the hard disk of a personal computer. Per the SD card specification, an SD card is formatted with MBR and the following file system: For SDSC cards: Capacity of less than 32,680 logical sectors (smaller than 16 MB): FAT12 with partition type 01h and BPB 3.0 or EBPB 4.1 [103]Capacity of 32,680 to 65,535 logical sectors (between 16 MB and 32 MB): FAT16 with partition type 04h and BPB 3.0 or EBPB 4.1 [103]Capacity of at least 65,536 logical sectors (larger than 32 MB): FAT16B with partition type 06h and EBPB 4.1 [103]For SDHC cards: Capacity of less than 16,450,560 logical sectors (smaller than 7.8 GB): FAT32 with partition type 0Bh and EBPB 7.1Capacity of at least 16,450,560 logical sectors (larger than 7.8 GB): FAT32 with partition type 0Ch and EBPB 7.1For SDXC cards: ex FAT with partition type 07h Most consumer products that take an SD card expect that it is partitioned and formatted in this way. Universal support for FAT12, FAT16, FAT16B, and FAT32 allows the use of SDSC and SDHC cards on most host computers with a compatible SD reader, to present the user with the familiar method of named files in a hierarchical directory tree. On such SD cards, standard utility programs such as Mac OS X's "" Disk Utility "" or Windows' SCANDISK can be used to repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. Defragmentation tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file, [104] but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical, and relatively slow, movement of a drive head. Moreover, defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card's rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on flash memory; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance. When reformatting an SD card with a capacity of at least 32 MB (65536 logical sectors or more), but not more than 2 GB, FAT16B with partition type 06h and EBPB 4.1 [103] is recommended if the card is for a consumer device. (FAT16B is also an option for 4 GB cards, but it requires the use of 64 ki B clusters, which are not widely supported.) FAT16B does not support cards above 4 GB at all. The SDXC specification mandates the use of Microsoft 's proprietary ex FAT file system, [105] which is supported only by some proprietary operating systems. Other file systems [ edit]This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)Because the host views the SD card as a block storage device, the card does not require MBR partitions or any specific file system. The card can be reformatted to use any file system the operating system supports. For example: Under Windows, SD cards can be formatted using NTFS and, on later versions, ex FAT. Under mac OS, SD cards can be partitioned as GUID devices and formatted with either HFS Plus or APFS file systems or still use ex FAT. Under Unix-like operating systems such as Linux or Free BSD, SD cards can be formatted using the UFS, Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, btrfs, HFS Plus, Reiser FS or F2FS file system. Additionally under Linux, HFS Plus file systems may be accessed for read/write if the ""hfsplus"" package is installed, and partitioned and formatted if ""hfsprogs"" is installed. (These package names are correct under Debian, Ubuntu etc., but may differ on other Linux distributions. )Any recent version of the above can format SD cards using the UDF file system. Additionally, as with live USB flash drives, an SD card can have an operating system installed on it. Computers that can boot from an SD card (either using a USB adapter or inserted into the computer's flash media reader) instead of the hard disk drive may thereby be able to recover from a corrupted hard disk drive. [106] Such an SD card can be write-locked to preserve the system's integrity. The SD Standard allows usage of only the above-mentioned Microsoft FAT file systems and any card produced in the market shall be preloaded with the related standard file system upon its delivery to the market. If any application or user re-formats the card with a non-standard file system the proper operation of the card, including interoperability, cannot be assured. Risks of reformatting [ edit]Reformatting an SD card with a different file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use wear leveling, in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32. [107] In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient. SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards have a ""Protected Area"" on the card for the SD standard's security function; a standard formatter may erase it, causing problems if security is used. The SD Association provides freely-downloadable SD Formatter software to overcome these problems for Windows and Mac OS X. [108] The SD Formatter does not format the ""Protected Area"", and the Association recommends the use of appropriate application software or SD-compatible device that provides SD security function to format the ""Protected Area"" in the memory card. Power consumption [ edit]The power consumption of SD cards varies by its speed mode, manufacturer and model. During transfer it may be in the range of 66–330 m W (20–100 m A at a supply voltage of 3.3 V). Specifications from Twin Mos technologies list a maximum of 149 m W (45 m A) during transfer. Toshiba lists 264–330 m W (80–100 m A). [109] Standby current is much lower, less than 0.2 m A for one 2006 micro SD card. [110] If there is data transfer for significant periods, battery life may be reduced noticeably (smartphones typically have batteries of capacity around 6 Wh (Samsung Galaxy S2, 1650 m Ah @ 3.7 V)). Modern UHS-II cards can consume up to 2.88 W, if the host device supports bus speed mode SDR104 or UHS-II. Minimum power consumption in the case of a UHS-II host is 0.72 W.

By the time the version 2.0 (SDHC) specification was completed in June 2006, [112] vendors had already devised 2 GB and 4 GB SD cards, either as specified in Version 1.01, or by creatively reading Version 1.00. The resulting cards do not work correctly in some host devices. [113] [114]SDSC cards above 1 GB [ edit]4 GB SDSC card A host device can ask any inserted SD card for its 128-bit identification string (the Card-Specific Data or CSD). In standard-capacity cards (SDSC), 12 bits identify the number of memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 bits identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster). The host device multiplies these figures (as shown in the following section) with the number of bytes per block to determine the card's capacity in bytes. [ citation needed]SD version 1.00 assumed 512 bytes per block. This permitted SDSC cards up to 4,096 × 512 × 512 = 1 GB, for which there are no known incompatibilities. [ citation needed]Version 1.01 let an SDSC card use a 4-bit field to indicate 1,024 or 2,048 bytes per block instead. [30] Doing so enabled cards with 2 GB and 4 GB capacity, such as the Transcend 4 GB SD card and the Memorette 4GB SD card. Early SDSC host devices that assume 512-byte blocks therefore do not fully support the insertion of 2 GB or 4 GB cards. In some cases, the host device can read data that happens to reside in the first 1 GB of the card. If the assumption is made in the driver software, success may be version-dependent. In addition, any host device might not support a 4 GB SDSC card, since the specification lets it assume that 2 GB is the maximum for these cards. [ citation needed]Storage capacity calculations [ edit]The format of the Card-Specific Data (CSD) register changed between version 1 (SDSC) and version 2.0 (which defines SDHC and SDXC). Version 1 [ edit]In version 1 of the SD specification, capacities up to 2 GB are calculated by combining fields of the CSD as follows: Capacity= ( C_SIZE +1) × 2 ( C_SIZE_MULT + 2 + READ_BL_LEN) Where: 0 ≤ C_SIZE ≤ 4095, 0 ≤ C_SIZE_MULT ≤ 7, READ_BL_LEN is 9 (for 512 bytes/sector) or 10 (for 1024 bytes/sector)Later versions state (at Section 4.3.2) that a 2 GB SDSC card shall set its READ_BL_LEN (and WRITE_BL_LEN) to indicate 1024 bytes, so that the above computation correctly reports the card's capacity; but that, for consistency, the host device shall not request (by CMD16) block lengths over 512bytes. [30]Versions 2 and 3 [ edit]In the definition of SDHC cards in version 2.0, the C_SIZE portion of the CSD is 22 bits and it indicates the memory size in multiples of 512 KB (the C_SIZE_MULT field is removed and READ_BL_LEN is no longer used to compute capacity). Two bits that were formerly reserved now identify the card family: 0 is SDSC; 1 is SDHC or SDXC; 2 and 3 are reserved. [30] Because of these redefinitions, older host devices do not correctly identify SDHC or SDXC cards nor their correct capacity. SDHC cards are restricted to reporting a capacity not over 32 GB. SDXC cards are allowed to use all 22 bits of the C_SIZE field. An SDHC card that did so (reported C_SIZE > 65375 to indicate a capacity of over 32 GB) would violate the specification. A host device that relied on C_SIZE rather than the specification to determine the card's maximum capacity might support such a card, but the card might fail in other SDHC-compatible host devices. Capacity is calculated thus: Capacity= ( C_SIZE +1) × 524288 where for SDHC 4112 ≤ C_SIZE ≤ 65375 (approx. 2 GB) ≤ capacity ≤ 32 GB for SDXC 65535 ≤ C_SIZE 32GB ≤ capacity ≤ 2TB max. Capacities above 4 GB can only be achieved by following version 2.0 or later versions. In addition, capacities equal to 4 GB must also do so to guarantee compatibility. Openness of specification [ edit]Dismantled micro SD to SD adapter showing the passive connection from the micro SD card slot on the bottom to the SD pins on the top Like most memory card formats, SD is covered by numerous patents and trademarks. Royalties for SD card licences are imposed for manufacture and sale of memory cards and host adapters (US$1,000/year plus membership at US$1,500/year), but SDIO cards can be made without royalties. Early versions of the SD specification were available only after agreeing to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that prohibited development of an open source driver. However, the system was eventually reverse-engineered, and free software drivers provided access to SD cards that did not use DRM. Since then, the SDA has provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license. [115] Although most open-source drivers were written before this, it has helped to solve compatibility issues. In 2006, the SDA released a simplified version of the specification of the host controller interface (as opposed to the specification of SD cards) and later also for the physical layer, ASSD extensions, SDIO, and SDIO Bluetooth Type-A, under a disclaimers agreement. [116] Again, most of the information had already been discovered and Linux had a fully free driver for it. Still, building a chip conforming to this specification caused the One Laptop per Child project to claim ""the first truly Open Source SD implementation, with no need to obtain an SDI license or sign NDAs to create SD drivers or applications."" [117]The proprietary nature of the complete SD specification affects embedded systems, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using USB -based card readers if necessary. These card readers present a standard USB mass storage interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from the details of the underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD card readers not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems. The SPI -bus interface mode is the only type that does not require a host license for accessing SD cards. Comparison to other flash memory formats [ edit]This section does not cite any sources.

Those open standards can be implemented without paying for licensing, royalties, or documentation. (Compact Flash and USB flash drives may require licensing fees for the use of the SDA's trademarked logos. )However, SD is much more open than Memory Stick, for which no public documentation nor any documented legacy implementation is available. All SD cards can be accessed freely using the well-documented SPI bus.x D cards are simply 18-pin NAND flash chips in a special package and support the standard command set for raw NAND flash access. Although the raw hardware interface to x D cards is well understood, the layout of its memory contents—necessary for interoperability with x D card readers and digital cameras—is totally undocumented.

Open Document Children's Private Speech Walk into any classroom or playground full of young children aged from four years old through to six or seven, and you will be overwhelmed by the constant noise. Now think back to your own childhood, and try to recall if it was that noisy when you were that age. If you can¡¦t , you are probably like the majority of people. But you will definitely remember the adults in your life telling you to ¡§shut up¡¨, ¡§be quiet¡¨ and ¡§sshhh¡¨. Many Psychologists have noted what is actually being said in all this noise, and attempted to establish what level of communication is actually taking place, and the purpose of this communication. A large proportion of this talking has been labeled ¡§ private speech ¡¨. Private speech could be defined as the ¡§speech uttered aloud by children which appears to be addressed to either themselves or to no one in particular¡¨ (Allyn & Bacon, date unknown). Many people have attempted to explain why children use private speech so prominently, and to explain the role that it plays in a child¡¦s development, if any at all. Piaget (1926) looked at the private speech phenomenon and referred to it as ¡§egocentric speech¡¨, as he believed it was the result of children being cognitively immature. He observed many children between the ages of four and six, and concluded that their private speech was egocentric as they were unable to communicate the views of others. Piaget also concluded that their speech was solely for themselves, and served ¡§no developmental or social purpose¡¨ (Allyn & Bacon). It was also suggested that as children grow older and their social skills develop, and they are able to adopt the perspectives of people, the amount of private speech they use decreases. This can easily be illustrated in Figure 1. Fig. 1 The relationship between a child¡¦s age and the amount of private speech used. Not everyone agreed with Piaget¡¦s thoughts and findings. Isaacs (1930), through his studies and observations of children in a small experimental school, noticed an extremely large amount of socialization taking place between the students of this age bracket. He also noted that the use of egocentric speech was found only in rare instances (Allyn & Bacon). This was supported by the findings of Mc Carthy (1930), who found that egocentric speech was only noticed in one out of every twenty subjects in his study of children aged between 18 and 54 months.

Title Length Color Rating Studies in Contemporary Literature: Free Speech - Censorship is the suppression of speech or other public communication which may be considered objectable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect or inconvenient as determined as determined by the government, media outlet, or other controlling bodies (Wikipedia, 1). This can be done by governments and private organizations or by individuals who engage in self-censorship which is the act of censoring or classifying one’s own work like blog, books, films, or other means of expression, out of the fear of, or deference to, the sensibilities of others, without overt pressure from any specific party or institution of authority....

Whether you are a parent, teacher, child care giver, or a child observer you may have noticed that many children talk to themselves. Laura Berk reports that, “private speech can account for 20-60 percent of the remarks a child younger than 10 years makes” (78). Why do children do this.

Vygotsky (1934) ¡§founded a theory which held that private speech performed a vital, positive function in a child¡¦s development (Allyn & Bacon). Piaget¡¦s theory of 1926, illustrated a converse association between egocentric speech and social communication. This is represented in Figure 2. Fig. 2 Piaget¡¦s theory a converse association between egocentric and social speech. Vygotsky¡¦s beliefs were somewhat different to that of Piaget. ¡§Vygotsky believed that private speech emerged out of social speech until the private speech peeked¡¨ (Allyn & Bacon). This can best be represented in Figure 3. Private speech is an integral function in the integration of language with thought. It helps young children to master their own behaviour (Allyn & Bacon). As these children grow and mature, their private speech becomes more internalized, and less vocal, as it transforms into the child¡¦s inner thoughts (Vygotsky, 1934). This means that the level of private speech a child uses, will gradually decrease after it reaches it¡¦s previously mentioned peek, as seen in Figure 4. Fig. 3 Vygotsky¡¦s beliefs of the relationship private and social speech. Fig. 4 Vygotsky¡¦s belief on the behaviour of private speech. This increase and then decrease in the use of private speech is due to the fact that children use private speech when they are faced with a new or difficult task or obstacle. At the age of four through to seven, children generally have not matured enough to internalize their thought processes, and hence use their private speech as a self-guiding and self-directional function. A child at the age of two is likely to use this language to account for it¡¦s actions, then at the age of four, will more likely to use private speech while they work, and then as the child get older, they may use it to assist with the planning of what they are about to undertake. Vygotsky believed that a child would take the instructional language of more mature individuals to assist them in achieving a task. The child would take this language and them incorporate it into their own private speech, which would assist with the child¡¦s cognitive development. While Vygotsky¡¦s findings were revolutionary for their time, Behaviorists were not particularly concerned with the implications they had on language for cognitive development (Allyn & Bacon). As Vygotsky¡¦s work was not even translated into English until 1962, it wasn¡¦t until late in the 20th century when a resolution to the differences between Vygotsky¡¦s and Piaget¡¦s theories could be sought. This lead to a test of Vygotsky¡¦s findings in 1968 by Kohlberg, Yaeger and Hjertholm. Their study involved observing many middle class students aged between four and seven, while they were playing at school. Piaget¡¦s theory would have suggested that Kohlberg, Yaeger and Hjertholm would have found that the children, who exhibited the least private speech, would be the most mature socially. The Kohlberg study actually found the direct opposite, that the more social students were the ones exhibiting the most private speech. They also found that the private speech of the cognitively advanced students peeked earlier than the private speech of students not as advanced cognitively. This is diagrammed in Figure 5. Fig. 5 Demonstrates that cognitively advanced children develop their private speech earlier than less cognitively advanced children. Private speech appears systematically in young children (Winsler, Carlton and Barry, 2000). Kohlberg (et al. 1968) also found that private speech developed in a set progression, moving from one developmental stage, to another, becoming inner directed speech and then finally, thought (see Fig. 6). Fig. 6 The three distinct stages in the progression from private speech to thought. Kohlberg, Yaeger and Hjertholm believed that private speech serves this one solitary purpose. This was viewed as an extreme assumption, and questions were asked if their theory would stand true universally. In 1984, Berk and Garvin made an in-depth appraisal of Vygotsky¡¦s theory. Berk and Garvin observed the private speech patterns of 36 children aged between five and ten (Allyn & Bacon). Vygotsky¡¦s belief that the origin of private speech was primarily, social, and that it increases when tasks become more difficult, was supported by their findings. The view of Kohlberg, that private speech only served one purpose, was not. ¡§We concluded that children¡¦s private speech is multi-faceted and diverse, consisting of different types, each serving a distinct developmental purpose, and each running it¡¦s own course¡¨ (Berk and Garvin, 1984). These types that Berk and Garvin refer include: „h Word play „h Emotional expression „h Self-image development, and „h Self-guiding / self-directional. The next step was to look at the relationship between private speech and academic performance, to investigate whether private speech assisted in the learning or outstanding of the child. In 1986, Berk observed 75 students from the first and third grades, whilst sitting a Mathematics test. She found that there was a strong correlation between certain type of private speech and the students test results, which means that a child¡¦s performance could be predicted by looking at the type of private speech that they used. Berk also made the generalization that younger children, with more audible private speech, performed better academically. Fig. 7 1st Graders Observed; those with more audible private speech, performed better academically. For the older children, Berk found the opposite. Those that were able to internalize their private speech, performed better in their Math¡¦s tests. Fig. 7 3rd Graders Observed; those with less audible private speech, performed better academically. The implications of these findings are many. And there are many more issues that can be explored. Rubin (1982) examined socially withdrawn children and their use of private speech, and concluded that fewer social skills resulted in greater private speech or fantasy play. Similarly, at-risk students use more overt, task-relevant private speech when problem solving (Winsler, Diaz, Mc Carthy, Atencio & Adams Chabay, 1999). This seems to support the view of Piaget, that private speech is egocentric. Rubin also suggests that this serves an important coping function in non-social children as it allows them to practice their social skills on themselves. Rubins work affirms, once again, that private speech must serve multiple functions (Allyn & Bacon). There are clearly many different views regarding the private speech of children. Different views regarding it origin, its function and purpose, and its impact on the children¡¦s lives. There are still many others questions about the use of private speech by children that could be answered. What effect does temperament and personality have on a child¡¦s private speech? How does private speech develop in children with learning disabilities? Do language customs affect the child¡¦s development of private speech? One thing that we can be sure of, is that private speech plays a major role in a child¡¦s development. Bibliography: Allyn, & Bacon. (date unknown). Inside psych ¡V childrens private speech.

By The Living Healthy Mom Tweet Sharebar I LOVE gluten free flour …………. and I have NO “issues” with gluten. Rather I eat gluten free flour because I love the taste and the health benefits. Even f you have NO “issues” with gluten, the wonderful taste and the health benefits of gluten free flour are STAGGERING!Gluten free flour can be used to make delicious baked treats that are really healthy for you and offer a variety of tastes that are different from our “wheat based society.” Once you start baking with gluten free flour, you will wonder why you have not always used these amazing flours before! If you want to know HOW to bake with gluten free flour, READ ON!What Is a “Primary” Gluten Free Flour? It is important to understand that when baking with gluten free flour, it is advised to combine multiple flours (primary and secondary flours) to achieve the desired taste. The reason is that combining different types of gluten free flour, helps the taste, and helps to bind your treat together. (Gluten holds things together and rich protein in flours or eggs can help substitute for this. However, if you used only one protein rich flour, it would not taste good; as it would be TOO heavy in protein. )The combination of flours is the magic trick!So what I mean by a “primary” gluten free flour is that you can use this type of flour with the highest percentage in your recipe. For example, if you need 2 cups of flour, you can use 1 1/2 cups of a “primary” gluten free flour, and then mix in other flour as a “secondary” as a general guideline. My Primary Gluten Free Flour Choices:#1. Coconut Flour Coconut flour is DELICIOUS. The biggest question I am asked…..does it taste like coconuts? No, it doesn’t make your food taste like coconuts, but it gives food a moisture that is wonderful and very healthy too! There are some recipes and cookbooks out there that enable you to cook ONLY using coconut flour; which would technically make it a primary flour, but I add it to the secondary list for most cases. Bruce Fife wrote the book Cooking with Coconut Flour where you can use coconut flour as a primary flour…..with A LOT of eggs. I like his recipes if you double all of them to get 12 servings, and would recommend his book. I typically use coconut flour as a “secondary gluten free flour” when I am creating recipes. Tip: When baking with this gluten free flour, your recipe will need more moisture and more eggs to bind than many of the other flours. “A little coconut flour goes a long way.”This fabulous gluten free flour can be used on it’s own as long as you have enough protein to bind it together. (Typically requires a lot of eggs) You can also use this flour as the primary flour and augment it with other gluten free flours. It is DELICIOUS and so healthy for you.#2. Blanched Almond flour Almond flour is my favorite primary gluten free flour…….. HANDS DOWN! This uniqu e gluten free flour does not require the addition of other flours, as long as you are using a recipe that was designed for it. In saying that, almond flour also works really well in combining with other gluten free flours. My favorite brand of blanched almond flour is from Honeyville, which I order online from Amazon. My favorite blanched almond flour cookbooks are from Elana Amsterdam. She is the guru of Almond flour!#3. Brown rice flour – This gluten free flour is a wonderful, healthy, primary flour and can be used as 75% of your flour source. Taken from the healthy “brown rice, this fiber rich flour is super healthy for kids and delicious!Don’t you agree that the Garbanzo Bean marketing department should change the name? Well, they have tried. This gluten free flour is also called Chick Pea flour or Gram flour. That is the BEST they could come up with?#4. Garbanzo bean flour – I know this gluten free flour doesn’t sound appetizing, but it is delicious, healthy and is a wonderful primary gluten free flour that you can use up to 75% in a recipe. And………….. NO, I know what you are thinking……… it doesn’t taste like beans! (I thought the same thing! )My Favorite “Secondary” Gluten Free Flours: A secondary gluten free flour, is one that you could combine with a primary flour to add nutrients, protein, taste for the health benefits and to help bind the baked goods together. For example, if you used 1 1/2 cups of one of the primary flours, then you could combine a variety of “secondary” gluten free flour to make up the remaining 1/2 cup of flour that was left.1. Quinoa Flour Quinoa is a complete protein and is filled with health benefits. This gluten free flour is a very versatile and easy to bake with. Quinoa flour adds taste, moisture, protein and binding action to your baked treats; and should be a staple for gluten free baking.2. Millet Flour A healthy delicious and healthy gluten free flour, Millet flour is delicious to combine with other secondary flours.3. Amaranth Flour This gluten free flour is the most difficult to bake with. It is considered to be a “complete protein” and is very valuable to use for that reason. It also adds a sweet taste that is lovely. Please beware though that too much of this gluten free flou r can make your baked goods not turn out at all. Tip: Do not use more than 1/4 of a cup (TOPS) of Amaranth flour in any recipe. Even 1-2 tablespoons enriches the health benefits of your treat.4. Almond Meal Please don’t confuse almond meal with blanched almond flour. They are NOT the same. Almond meal grinds up the entire almond, where blanched almond flour removes the skin. The skin is loaded with health benefits, so almond meal is very good to use in cooking and baking; but only in very small amounts. Almond meal doesn’t act like a “flour” would, and is best to add no more than 1/2 cup if you are replacing flour. There are so many different types of gluten free flou r including: buckwheat, corn flour, potato flour, soya flour, tapioca flour, white rice flour, teff flour and sorghum flour to name a few. I have not used every gluten free flour there is in baking; but when I do test each and every one of them….. I will let you know what I find. Please share your experiences in the comments below.

While Christopher Nolan was making Interstellar, he decided to show a model of the movie’s bots to his kids. They were extremely disappointed. “That’s not a robot,” they told him. “That’s a box.” Well, it’s true: Nolan’s intelligent machines, which he dreamed up with production designer Nathan Crowley, look for all the universe like slabs of metal. The main bot, named TARS (which doesn’t stand for anything), might as well be a distant cousin of 2001‘s monolith. Then again, nothing in Nolan’s world (s) is what it seems. “When I let my kids play with the model, open it up, see different combinations,” he says, “they started getting really excited.” Let’s peek inside the box.share improve this answeredited Feb 13 '15 at 14:02Valorum340k 87 25072737answered Jan 6 '15 at 2:06Organic Marble19k 3 66 102They may not stand for anything, but do they have any in-universe significance? – phantom42 Jan 6 '15 at 3:20add a commentprotected by Community ♦ Feb 13 '15 at 13:58Thank you for your interest in this question.

On Monday, a warrant was issued for the 16-year-old, charging him as an adult with two counts of murder in the stabbing death of his mother, Elvira Canales-Gomez, 40, and his 9-year-old brother, Cesar Navarro. By Brian Nordli Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2013 | 10:39 a.m. Mom, son found Sun coverage Arrest warrant issued for teen in deaths of mother, brother Relatives reeling after Henderson mom, son found dead; neighborhood in shock Mother, boy found dead in Henderson apartment; another son missing More breaking news Henderson Police discovered their bodies on Friday inside the bathroom — a 9-year-old boy in the bathtub and his mother on the floor next to him. The mother, Elvira Canales-Gomez, 40, had a large butcher’s knife in her chest and multiple stab wounds, and the boy, Cesar Navarro, had a stab wound in his chest. The officers smelled the odor of human decomposition, which filled the Summit at Sunridge apartment in the 11000 block of South Eastern Avenue, indicating they had been dead for a while. Missing from the apartment was Canales-Gomez’s 16-year-old son Adrian Navarro-Canales, who is wanted in connection with their deaths. These were the details outlined in a Henderson Police arrest warrant for Navarro-Canales, who has been missing since Friday and is wanted on two charges of murder with use of a deadly weapon. The warrant details the events leading up to the discovery of the bodies: Earlier in the week, on Monday, the family and Canales-Gomez’s boyfriend held a small celebration for Navarro-Canales’ birthday. Relatives described the boy as anti-social, often secluding himself inside the apartment to play video games. He wanted to return to Mexico and had stopped attending Coronado High School in November 2012. The next day, a neighbor saw Canales-Gomez picking Cesar up at Lamping Elementary School and spoke briefly on the phone with her boyfriend on the way home. That was the last time she was heard from. The mother’s boyfriend tried reaching her at the family’s apartment multiple times. On Tuesday, the lights were off, so he assumed they were sleeping. The next day he noticed a kitchen light was on through a window, but no one answered the door. Henderson Police conducted their first welfare check Wednesday, but no one answered the door. On Wednesday, Navarro-Canales texted his father, Enrique Velasquez, who lived in Northern California, telling him everything was fine at the home. He said his mother and brother were sleeping so they couldn’t answer the phone. Henderson Police conducted a second welfare check on Friday, at the behest of a family relative who said Canales-Gomez hadn’t shown up for work and Cesar wasn’t going school. Detectives believe Canales-Gomez and Cesar had been dead since Tuesday and that Navarro-Canales had lived in the home after they died. Police have been searching for Navarro-Canales since Friday. Police urge anyone with information regarding the incident or the whereabouts of Navarro-Canales to call Henderson Police at 267-4750 or, to remain anonymous, contact Crime Stoppers at 385-5555 or online at crimestoppersofnv.com.0 Comments Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the Live Fyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

D819746	http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/06/ohio_legalized_medical_marijua.html	Ohio legalized medical marijuana: Here's what you need to know	"OPEN: Ohio Politics Ohio legalized medical marijuana: Here's what you need to know Updated April 6, 2017 at 9:43 PM; Posted June 9, 2016 at 11:45 AMOhio legalized medical marijuana but it could be two years before the program is fully operational. ( Teresa Crawford, Associated Press )Comment By Jackie Borchardt, cleveland.comjborchardt@cleveland.com COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio legalized medical marijuana, but that doesn't mean anyone can light up a joint whenever they please -- far from it. Legislation signed Wednesday by Gov. John Kasich creates a regulated program controlled by three government agencies that won't be set up for at least a year. And the law explicitly prohibits smoking marijuana or growing it at home. The law leaves much of the details of the program up to the Ohio Department of Commerce, State Pharmacy Board, State Medical Board and a yet to be appointed bipartisan advisory committee. But here are answers to some of readers' most frequently asked questions about the law. What are the qualifying medical conditions? Patients qualify if they have the following conditions: HIV/AIDS; Alzheimer's disease; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); cancer; chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); Crohn's disease; epilepsy or another seizure disorder; fibromyalgia; glaucoma; hepatitis C; inflammatory bowel disease; multiple sclerosis; pain that is chronic and severe, or intractable; Parkinson's disease; post traumatic stress disorder; sickle cell anemia; spinal cord disease or injury; Tourette's syndrome; traumatic brain injury; and ulcerative colitis. Individuals can petition the state medical board to add conditions. Doctors must register with the state, which will require completing some type of continuing education about cannabis, before being able to recommend marijuana to patients with whom they have bona fide relationships. The patient registration process would be determined by the Ohio State Pharmacy Board. When can I use marijuana? If you would qualify under the law's conditions (see below) and have written permission from your doctor, then you could use marijuana without going to jail in early September. The exact date will be 90 days from when the secretary of state officially files the law. The law doesn't say where patients would get their marijuana before dispensaries are set up, but it's assumed they would get it from another state or Ohio's existing black market. Dispensaries won't be set up for a least a year, maybe longer. The law requires the whole program to be operational within two years. Can registered patients get fired for using medical marijuana? Yes. Despite changing state laws, marijuana remains illegal federally. Courts have consistently upheld employers' right to fire employees for marijuana use, even when it didn't happen on the job. Ohio is an at-will state where employees can be fired for any reason. Additionally, the law specifies that employees can be fired for marijuana use even if it was recommended to them by a doctor if the employer has a drug-free workplace or zero tolerance policy in place. Employees fired for medical marijuana use are not eligible for unemployment compensation. I want to own a marijuana business. How can I get a business license? Details about license requirements and applications are not yet known. The Department of Commerce, in conjunction with a 14-member bipartisan advisory committee, has until May 2017 to figure that out for cultivators. Lawmakers expect seeds to be in the ground next summer. The rules and regulations for dispensaries, testing labs and marijuana processors, which will make marijuana-infused products and package everything for sale, must be determined by September 2017. Will there be a dispensary in my neighborhood? Maybe. The law requires 500 feet between any marijuana business and a school, church, public library or public playground. Local governments can restrict where cultivators, processors and dispensaries can be located or ban them altogether. The state pharmacy board will decide how many dispensary licenses to issue, and the law requires it take into account the state's population, patient demand and ensuring dispensaries are not just concentrated in certain parts of the state. Why no smoking or home grow? Patients and/or their caregivers can grow their own marijuana in 15 of the 25 medical marijuana states. Four of the 25 states prohibit smoking marijuana, and an additional 17 states allow use of marijuana products that are low in THC, the compound that generates a ""high. ""Lawmakers said smoking marijuana or growing it outside of a strictly regulated program were off the table from the beginning. Both aspects ventured into the realm of recreational use, lawmakers said, and would have been deal breakers for legislators whose votes were crucial to the bill's passage. Also, lawmakers said the idea that people would ""smoke their medicine"" went against common sense and prevalent public health messages against cigarette smoking. The law does allow patients to inhale vaporized marijuana. To read text of the new law, click here. Follow @JMBorchardt Follow me on Facebook. View Comments "

D1156912	http://www.sakrete.com/media-center/blog-detail.cfm/bp_alias/Placing-Concrete-in-hot-or-cold-weather	Placing Concrete in Hot or Cold Weather	Placing Concrete in Hot or Cold Weather Share: People who pour concrete for a living can work almost year round in most parts of the country. This is because either through trial and error or spending time reading a lot of technical journals they have figured out how to successfully place concrete even though it is sweltering hot or freezing cold. For almost everyone else I would recommend that you limit your concrete activities to more moderate weather. If it’s so hot out that all you can think about is going for a swim I would suggest you get a cold beverage, turn up the AC and forget the concrete. If it’s so cold that you need gloves, consider spending time in front of the fireplace with a good book. If this doesn’t quite give you specific enough guidelines, maybe we should define what moderate temperatures are? This is open for debate and involves other factors but in general if the air temperature is between 50° F and 90° F you should be safe. You can safely place concrete outside of these limits but you need to do a few things to make sure your job won’t turn into a nightmare. The air temperature by itself isn’t the determining factor on whether you should pour concrete. The temperature of the air, the humidity level, and the wind speed, the temperatures of the surface where you are placing the concrete, the water and the dry concrete in the bag all play a huge part and must be taken into consideration. The air, wind and humidity are pretty much beyond your control but some of the others you can influence. It is important to remember that the temperature of the mixed material is as important as the air temperature. Cold Weather If the air temperature is below 32° F I would really advise that you wait until warmer weather or call a pro. Unless you want to erect a tent with a space heater or steal your spouse’s electric blanket off the bed, this will only lead to trouble. If it is so cold out that the ground is frozen don’t pour concrete under any circumstances. The biggest issue when pouring concrete when the air temperature is just above freezing is the night time temperatures that will follow. Concrete sets much slower in cold weather. It is critical (I’m going to repeat that- critical) that the concrete sets before it is exposed to freezing temperatures. The problem is that when water freezes it takes up more space in the ice phase than it does in the liquid phase. When all of the water that you used for mixing freezes, it expands, causing your concrete to crack. The key is doing what you can to make sure the concrete sets fast enough to prevent this. The first thing that pros do in the winter is use hot water. If you use hot water and keep the dry product in a heated area of your house or garage until you are ready to use it this will greatly accelerate the set of the concrete. You can buy products designed to set quick such as Sakrete Fast Setting Concrete. It will not set as fast as the literature says it will if the air temp is anywhere near freezing but it will set much faster than normal concrete. You can also buy additives to accelerate the set. The only concern here is the type of accelerator. If it contains calcium chloride and your concrete will contain rebar or metal wire mesh, the chlorides will attack it and produce rust. This will ultimately crack your concrete. When concrete sets it gives off heat. Not like frying an egg but there is a slightly exothermic reaction (a big word for a reaction that gives off heat-use it to impress your friends). You can use this to your advantage by covering the concrete (after it has stiffened) with a blanket. They sell blankets for this purpose so your kids won’t have to sleep in the cold. You could also put up a tent or lean to and put a space heater inside. Hot Weather If the air temperature is above 90° F you need to be careful. Of course what you are doing with the concrete also makes a difference. We will address that later. In addition if the wind is blowing hard and the humidity is low, even 90° might be a problem. The issue with hot weather isn’t really the heat. Neither the cement nor the aggregates have a problem with temperature. This isn’t like a chocolate bar on the front seat of the car in July. The issue is that the top layer of concrete will dry much faster than the bottom layer. As concrete dries it shrinks. This means that the top will be shrinking while the bottom is stationary. At this point you get your own north/south civil war breaking out inside the slab. There will be casualties. To avoid this aggression you need to keep the top and the bottom curing at the same rate. There are several things you can do before and during mixing and several things you can do after placement. Before mixing store the material in a cool place or at least avoid laying it in the hot direct sun. Then use the coldest water that you find. Ready mixed concrete companies actual use ice to replace all or most of the water to slow down the set. After you have placed the concrete and it has taken a set, you need to keep the slab moist. This can be done in several ways. You can spray the slab periodically with a hose, turn on a sprinkler with a fine mist, cover the slab with wet burlap or with chemicals designed to keep water from evaporating so quickly. In very high temperatures, very low humidity or high winds you may to do this for several days. Almost everything in this discussion on hot weather is directed at someone pouring a slab. If you are mixing up concrete and placing it in a hole to support a fence post of deck, hot weather normally isn’t a problem. If the concrete is setting too fast to place in the hole, then using cold mixing water or ice will help. Comments: Lee-Technical Service06.06.2017Siaosi, the best conditions are when the air, mix and substrate temperatures are between 40°F and 90°F with no rain in the forecast within 24 hours of application. Protect from freezing for at least 48 hours.siaosi04.14.2017I did not know that cold temperatures actually could affect the cement when being laid. I think it would be nice to make sure that everything is done correctly. I want to know that I have the right weather. Lee-Technical Service03.03.2017Meg, for best results all materials should be stored between 40°F and 80°F 24 hours prior to installation. Air, mix and substrate temperatures should be between 40°F and 90°F with no rain in the forecast within 24 hours of application. Colder temperatures or higher humidity conditions will retard set times. Protect from freezing for 48 hours. These are the parameters for using our concrete materials. Meg02.27.2017We won a federal grant for concrete walkway construction throughout our community. It should have funded in July, but did not fund until November. I have put off the installation of the walkways until the weather reaches a consistently warmer temperature 45 degrees average for a period of 4 or more days. The government is saying that because we have had a milder winter that we should have already started work. I am concerned about durability and strength if we go too soon. Opinions, please? Thanks. Lee-Technical Service02.06.2017Sandra, sorry but I am not able to answer that question. You will need to have either the contractor or an inspector to evaluate the condition of the concrete.sandra02.04.2017people poured our driveway dec. 2016 when it was below freezing and snowing they covered it with blankets but it is already cracking and on top of concrete is white discolor on top do you think it will be ok Lee-Technical Service01.12.2017R Taylor, if the material freezes then it can crack. The cold weather slows the set time and this will cause issues if your low temperatures are below 40 degrees. If it is too hot then the concrete can set too fast and cause shrinkage cracking. You want to install concrete between a high of 90 degrees and a low of 40 degrees. R Taylor01.11.2017is cement more likely to crack if poured in cold weather or warm weather? Lee-Technical Service11.29.2016Maureen, I would not start it before the weather is within the optimal temperature range. Especially if you plan on closing it in. You want to make sure that it is done right the first time so that none of your finish materials end up getting damaged. Maureen11.28.2016What about patching think cracks on a screened in back porch? The man who was supposed to do this, check moisture, etc. did not show up. This screened in porch will be turned into a 4 season room but will not get done until about a week before Christmas. Should I wait until warmer weather to do anything? I dread having all this done once enclosed but may have to. I wanted the repairs down early on so that the flooring could be installed before Christmas. Local installer said he would. Now? I am in Chesterton, IN zip 46304- cold and raining today. Guess I don't get to use this for the great grandkids to play in this Christmas. Thank you. Load More View All Leave a Comment: Display Name Add Your Comments Submit Comment Back to Blog 
D2753742	http://www.pitchsoftball.com/AvoidPitchingInjuries-WhatNOTToDo.html	.	by Gerald Warner, Softball Pitching Instructor Softball pitchers…even those with years of experience… often develop (or were even taught)incorrect pitching mechanics. Some can become successful. However, the majority don’t reach their maximum potential, and a large percentage end up with short-term, or even career-ending, pitching injuries. OUR TOP 10 INJURY-CAUSING PITCHING PROBLEMSIf you are doing any of these things, find a way to stop it1) OVERUSE – A significant percentage of softball pitching injuries are shoulder and rotator cuff problems caused by too much pitching, often by using incorrect pitching mechanics. Although there is no single recommendation on the number of pitches, innings pitched, or rest between pitching appearances that can apply to all ages and sizes of pitchers, some restraint is advised. A pitcher who repeats the same pitch over and over, such as the rollover drop ball, faces a potential overuse injury.2) INSUFFICIENT STRETCHING AND WARM-UP – Many athletes tend to rush through pre-practice or pre-game preparation. Most serious pitchers need a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes of JOGGING, STRETCHING, SOFT OVERHAND THROWING, and FULL DISTANCE OVERHAND THROWING before they throw their first underhand pitch. Never stretch a tight muscle. A 3 to 5-minute jog will loosen muscles before you start stretch. Stretch for 5 to 10 minutes. Pay attention to hamstrings, core muscles with twist cross-body stretches, shoulders, arm rotation, and wrist movement.3) BENDING AT THE WAIST – We see far too many young pitchers…and even some experienced ones…who bend at the waist during the final portion of their pitching motion. Bending is okay during the drive off the pitching rubber. However, at the release of the pitch, bending forward causes a slower pitch and often can lead to back injuries. In still-frame video analysis, we often see some pitchers bending forward (a right-hander bends toward 3 rd base…a lefty toward 1 st)as they are in the “open” position halfway through their arm rotation. This can be even more injury producing because it puts a severe 2-way torque on the pitcher’s back.4) “SNAPPING” THE RELEASE – Often very young pitchers get into the habit of stopping their arm motion as soon as the ball leaves their hand. Although a snap release can be used on occasion on some advanced pitches, it should never be a common practice on your most-used pitch…either a fastball or drop ball. Continued snapping without a natural follow-through can lead to elbow and forearm injuries. A good follow-through on most pitches will allow the arm to relax and bend immediately after the release, then follow up naturally to at least waist high…and some pitchers’ follow through can continue until the hand approaches the shoulder. 5) “CHICKEN-WINGING” – We often refer to a pitcher’s elbow that flies out during the pitching motion as a “chicken wing”. Since this is not a natural part of a pitch release or follow-through, it can often lead to elbow and shoulder problems…as well as cause a problem with pitch control. Pitchers who use the rollover/snapover method for their drop ball will often “chicken wing” at the release, and sometimes involve a twisting of the arm all the way up to the shoulder. To impart a tight spin (and avoid injury) with the rollover drop, use only the forearm and wrist to snap the ball. If necessary, lock your elbow against your side at the release to avoid using the upper arm and shoulder.6) PRACTICING BREAKING PITCHES BEFORE YOU ARE READY – Pre-teen pitchers are often encouraged to start work on drop balls, curve balls, etc. even though their bone structure and dexterity aren’t ready yet. Breaking pitches typically require a hard, tight wrist snap to impart a fast spin on the ball. Most 10, 11, and 12-year old pitchers…and even many who are older…are not yet sufficiently physically developed to work on pitches that require a hard snap of the wrist. Don’t be tempted to do too much too soon! Most young pitchers who brag about their curve, screw, or even rise ball don’t throw those pitches effectively.7) PITCHING FROM THE “OPEN” POSITION – Some pitchers are taught to “keep your body open (sideways to the catcher) when you release the ball”. Unfortunately, many who are taught with this method develop a problem of bending at the waist (right-hander bends toward 3 rdbase) during the final downswing and through the release of the pitch. Needless to say, this additional torque can put severe pressure on the pitcher’s back and often results in lower back injuries.8) IMPROPER LANDING OF THE STRIDE FOOT – Since the majority of female fastpitch pitchers use the “leap and drag” style of pitching, it is important that the stride leg drives out fast and far. Ideally, the knee will be slightly bent at landing and the stride foot will land at an angle of between 20 and 30 degrees. If the pitcher’s foot is pointing more directly toward the catcher, it can cause the bent knee to “buckle” and lead to injury. If the foot lands at more of an angle…more than 45 degrees, it is too far sideways, and the “blocking” or pushback against the landing foot can cause an ankle, calf, and/or knee problem. 9) “JERKING” THE SHOULDERS OR HEAD BACK AT THE RELEASE OF THE PITCH – Although rare, some pitchers can develop a body “jerk” as they whip their arm down through the release point. Although this “arm whip” is essential for maximizing the speed of the pitch, it should not involve any snapping of the upper back, neck, or head. Some pitchers who have developed this “jerking” motion suffered back or neck injuries. Those who haven’t corrected the problem are facing a similar risk.10) DOING THINGS THE WAY A MAN PITCHER DOES IT – We have mentioned several times on our www.pitchsoftball.com website that a majority of fastpitch softball pitching instructors are men. Unfortunately, there is a tendency by many male instructors to tell girl softball pitchers to “do it the way I do it” regardless of the girl’s age, size, physical and emotional development, athletic ability, etc. The way a 220-lb, 6-foot tall man throws a pitch doesn’t always apply to a 10-year old girl, and isn’t even necessarily right for a 120-lb. teenage girl pitcher. There are alternate ways of throwing a change-up, drop ball, curve ball, etc. that need to be adjusted to the needs and comfort-level of the pitcher. Pitching should be a rewarding, and as much as possible, an injury-free experience. If you are doing anything that has caused or could eventually lead to injuries, NOW is the time to correct it. Don’t let a bad habit or improper mechanics hurt your game.

D3542840	http://antiques.about.com/od/artglass/a/aa021900.htm	Fenton Glassware Collecting	"Antiques Fenton Glassware Collecting Fancy Frills in Art Glass By Pamela Wiggins Updated 04/13/17Share Pin Email Fenton Glassware at Gannon's Antiques & Art in Fort Myers, Florida. Gannon's Antiques & Art This firm got its start as a glass decorating company in 1905 painting on plain blanks made by other glassware manufacturers. As demand for the company's wares increased, they began to produce their own glassware lines in 1907 after moving from Ohio to Williamstown, West Virgina. During their early years, Fenton found inspiration from the designs of glass masters Tiffany and Steuben. As a result, they introduced iridescent glass collectors now know as carnival glass. Fenton went on to produce more than 130 patterns of this popular glassware, according to information formerly published in Schroeder's Antiques Price Guide (now out of print), and some of them sell for very good sums today. Over the years they also manufactured custard glass, chocolate glass, opalescent glass, and stretch glass among others. And, to keep the factory running during the lean Depression and World War II years, they made utilitarian items such as mixing bowls, juice reamers, and other glass kitchen items. In the late '40s when many glass companies were going out of business, Fenton stayed on course as a result of dedicated family members piloting the company. By 1986, a third generation of Fentons took charge of the business, and continued to make glassware collected and admired around the world. Hobnails, Ruffles and Crests The popularity of milk glass in the early 1950s led the company to develop a line of white Hobnail glass. It was so well-liked during this period that they counted on it as a sure seller for many years to come. Now, while these milk glass pieces do have their ardent fans, they are usually fairly reasonably priced in the secondary collectibles marketplace. Other Hobnail patterns, such as opalescent hobnail on cranberry, blue or green glass, can be worth quite a bit more depending on the item. It's hard to generalize on value with these pieces though, so each one much be researched individually to ferret out rarities. The unique ruffled edges found on many Fenton wares also worked perfectly for the creation of the company's ""crest"" lines. Opaque glass, such as custard glass or milk glass, was often used to form the base of these items while a clear or colored border around the ruffled edge added a touch of interest. Pieces with a clear ruffle were named ""Silver Crest,"" while those with a bright green border were called ""Emerald Crest."" Other colors applied in the same fashion are popular with collectors including the ""Snow Crest"" and ""Ebony Crest"" pieces with reversed effect along the edges in opaque white or black. Some Ebony Crest pieces can be quite valuable with even small vases selling for prices in the hundreds when they can be found. Evaluating Fenton's Marks to Value Glass Many of the Fenton's items made since 1973 are already very collectible. These items are marked with an oval shaped Fenton raised logo molded directly into the glass. Pieces produced before 1973 were marked with various stick-on paper labels which usually wore away with cleaning and handling. While many pieces have an inherent Fenton look about them, others may not be as obvious and further research must be done to verify the maker. In 2004 Fenton issued guides they referred to as their ""history books"" which were available through their numerous glass dealers and directly from the company. Older glass made by this company can be researched through these guides, which are now out of print but can still be located with a little effort. A number of other out of print books on Fenton are also available through Amazon.com and Half.com, including several excellent reference guides authored by respected glass collectors and experts Margaret and Kenn Whitmyer. Once an older unsigned piece is identified as Fenton, then research can be done to assess the popularity of that particular item in terms of color, design, and decoration. The next step in evaluating a piece requires researching recent selling prices. Some early cranberry and carnival glass pieces can sell in the thousands. Don't let the high values of certain rarities scare you away though. You'll find far more Fenton pieces worth much less than $100 each. Many pieces sell for as little as $10-20, so each one must be researched individually to determine value. A beautiful collection of Fenton can still be amassed very reasonably for folks sticking to a budget. The End of an Era After flirting with financial difficulties for a number of years, this family-owned company officially closed its doors in 2011. As the largest producer of handmade colored glass in the country, the Fenton factory was the hub of tourism in its area of West Virginia by offering facility tours, a yearly tent sale, and a museum filled with beautiful glass to visitors who will surely miss this popular destination.

Other popular areas include insurance, wills and estate planning, and consumer and creditor protection. Business law may include issues such as starting, selling ,or buying a small business, managing a business, dealing with employees, or dealing with contracts, among others. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs sales and commercial paper, has been adopted in some form by almost all states. There are agencies at the state and federal level which adminster the law in such issues such as employment affairs and consumer and credit protection. The laws aim to protect fair business practices and due process rights for aggrieved workers and others.

If they create more immediate concerns – stomach, skin, lungs – they get all the “health headlines” in daily life. But how often do we think about the liver? We might be selling the liver short. The liver’s “to-do” list is huge. It helps metabolize carbs and maintain healthy glucose levels, stores and synthesizes vitamins, and regulates hormones, including estrogen. But, arguably one of the liver’s most important tasks is creating a substance called bile. Bile gets a bad rap because it just sounds bad. In the past, people would say someone was “filled with bile” if they had a bad temper. But has a big job. This greenish fluid starts breaking down the fats we eat so the body can use the fat-soluble nutrients hidden within them. It also shuttles toxins through the digestive system, acting as a detoxifying agent. In the intestines, bile hands over custody of toxins to fiber which helps move them through the digestive system to be excreted later. (That’s yet another reason why fiber intake is so important. )That’s why finding ingredients that support bile production – like those you’ll find in Complete Liver Cleanse is a big deal for the health of your liver and your entire body. †Unique ingredients – including fiber! This simple, two-week liver cleanse program removes toxins, and rejuvenates your liver with a set of unique ingredients. †Milk thistle – with an amazing compound called silymarin – actually supports liver health at a cellular level. † You’ve probably noticed this all-important herb included in other cleanses, for a good reason. It not only helps your liver detoxify and protects it from free radical damage, but supports the gall bladder, the intestines, and the circulatory system as well. †In Complete Liver Cleanse, this botanical extract is combined with other herbal ingredients that work together to stimulate the liver and increase bile production, including boldo, burdock, dandelion and artichoke.†Keeping healthy bile flow is part of the body’s natural “moving service” for toxins.†Other important members of the Complete Liver Cleanse team include: Calcium D-glucarate helps keep the compounds from reverting back to their original toxic state as they move through the gall bladder. †Phytosterols which help block cholesterol absorption in the intestines. †A dynamic fiber duo oat beta-glucan and glucomannan bind with the toxic excretions to prevent reabsorption back into the body. † This unique fiber blend moves the toxins through the intestines to be eliminated. †This is an extremely convenient cleanse—even the fiber is tucked inside of the vegetarian capsule!Give your liver a reward. The liver does a lot for us, but doesn’t get much reward in return. But adding Complete Liver Cleanse to your regimen can give your liver the love it so richly deserves.

Kinematics with Graphs Since you are not allowed to use calculators, SAT II Physics places a heavy emphasis on qualitative problems. A common way of testing kinematics qualitatively is to present you with a graph plotting position vs. time, velocity vs. time, or acceleration vs. time and to ask you questions about the motion of the object represented by the graph. Because SAT II Physics is entirely made up of multiple-choice questions, you won’t need to know how to draw graphs; you’ll just have to interpret the data presented in them. Knowing how to read such graphs quickly and accurately will not only help you solve problems of this sort, it will also help you visualize the often-abstract realm of kinematic equations. In the examples that follow, we will examine the movement of an ant running back and forth along a line. Position vs. Time Graphs Position vs. time graphs give you an easy and obvious way of determining an object’s displacement at any given time, and a subtler way of determining that object’s velocity at any given time. Let’s put these concepts into practice by looking at the following graph charting the movements of our friendly ant. Any point on this graph gives us the position of the ant at a particular moment in time. For instance, the point at (2,–2) tells us that, two seconds after it started moving, the ant was two centimeters to the left of its starting position, and the point at (3,1) tells us that, three seconds after it started moving, the ant is one centimeter to the right of its starting position. Let’s read what the graph can tell us about the ant’s movements. For the first two seconds, the ant is moving to the left. Then, in the next second, it reverses its direction and moves quickly to y = 1. The ant then stays still at y = 1 for three seconds before it turns left again and moves back to where it started. Note how concisely the graph displays all this information. Calculating Velocity We know the ant’s displacement, and we know how long it takes to move from place to place. Armed with this information, we should also be able to determine the ant’s velocity, since velocity measures the rate of change of displacement over time. If displacement is given here by the vector y , then the velocity of the ant is If you recall, the slope of a graph is a measure of rise over run; that is, the amount of change in the y direction divided by the amount of change in the x direction. In our graph, is the change in the y direction and is the change in the x direction, so v is a measure of the slope of the graph. For any position vs. time graph, the velocity at time t is equal to the slope of the line at t. In a graph made up of straight lines, like the one above, we can easily calculate the slope at each point on the graph, and hence know the instantaneous velocity at any given time. We can tell that the ant has a velocity of zero from t = 3 to t = 6 , because the slope of the line at these points is zero. We can also tell that the ant is cruising along at the fastest speed between t = 2 and t = 3 , because the position vs. time graph is steepest between these points. Calculating the ant’s average velocity during this time interval is a simple matter of dividing rise by run, as we’ve learned in math class. Average Velocity How about the average velocity between t = 0 and t = 3 ? It’s actually easier to sort this out with a graph in front of us, because it’s easy to see the displacement at t = 0 and t = 3 , and so that we don’t confuse displacement and distance. Average Speed Although the total displacement in the first three seconds is one centimeter to the right, the total distance traveled is two centimeters to the left, and then three centimeters to the right, for a grand total of five centimeters. Thus, the average speed is not the same as the average velocity of the ant. Once we’ve calculated the total distance traveled by the ant, though, calculating its average speed is not difficult: Curved Position vs. Time Graphs This is all well and good, but how do you calculate the velocity of a curved position vs. time graph? Well, the bad news is that you’d need calculus. The good news is that SAT II Physics doesn’t expect you to use calculus, so if you are given a curved position vs. time graph, you will only be asked qualitative questions and won’t be expected to make any calculations. A few points on the graph will probably be labeled, and you will have to identify which point has the greatest or least velocity. Remember, the point with the greatest slope has the greatest velocity, and the point with the least slope has the least velocity. The turning points of the graph, the tops of the “hills” and the bottoms of the “valleys” where the slope is zero, have zero velocity. In this graph, for example, the velocity is zero at points A and C , greatest at point D, and smallest at point B. The velocity at point B is smallest because the slope at that point is negative. Because velocity is a vector quantity, the velocity at B would be a large negative number. However, the speed at B is greater even than the speed at D : speed is a scalar quantity, and so it is always positive. The slope at B is even steeper than at D , so the speed is greatest at B. Velocity vs. Time Graphs Velocity vs. time graphs are the most eloquent kind of graph we’ll be looking at here. They tell us very directly what the velocity of an object is at any given time, and they provide subtle means for determining both the position and acceleration of the same object over time. The “object” whose velocity is graphed below is our ever-industrious ant, a little later in the day. We can learn two things about the ant’s velocity by a quick glance at the graph. First, we can tell exactly how fast it is going at any given time. For instance, we can see that, two seconds after it started to move, the ant is moving at 2 cm/s. Second, we can tell in which direction the ant is moving. From t = 0 to t = 4, the velocity is positive, meaning that the ant is moving to the right. From t = 4 to t = 7, the velocity is negative, meaning that the ant is moving to the left. Calculating Acceleration We can calculate acceleration on a velocity vs. time graph in the same way that we calculate velocity on a position vs. time graph. Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity vector,, which expresses itself as the slope of the velocity vs. time graph. For a velocity vs. time graph, the acceleration at time t is equal to the slope of the line at t. What is the acceleration of our ant at t = 2.5 and t = 4? Looking quickly at the graph, we see that the slope of the line at t = 2.5 is zero and hence the acceleration is likewise zero. The slope of the graph between t = 3 and t = 5 is constant, so we can calculate the acceleration at t = 4 by calculating the average acceleration between t = 3 and t = 5: The minus sign tells us that acceleration is in the leftward direction, since we’ve defined the y -coordinates in such a way that right is positive and left is negative. At t = 3 , the ant is moving to the right at 2 cm/s, so a leftward acceleration means that the ant begins to slow down. Looking at the graph, we can see that the ant comes to a stop at t = 4 , and then begins accelerating to the right. Calculating Displacement Velocity vs. time graphs can also tell us about an object’s displacement. Because velocity is a measure of displacement over time, we can infer that: Graphically, this means that the displacement in a given time interval is equal to the area under the graph during that same time interval. If the graph is above the t -axis, then the positive displacement is the area between the graph and the t -axis. If the graph is below the t -axis, then the displacement is negative, and is the area between the graph and the t -axis. Let’s look at two examples to make this rule clearer. First, what is the ant’s displacement between t = 2 and t = 3? Because the velocity is constant during this time interval, the area between the graph and the t -axis is a rectangle of width 1 and height 2. The displacement between t = 2 and t = 3 is the area of this rectangle, which is 1 cm/s s = 2 cm to the right. Next, consider the ant’s displacement between t = 3 and t = 5. This portion of the graph gives us two triangles, one above the t -axis and one below the t -axis. Both triangles have an area of 1 / 2 (1 s ) (2 cm/s ) = 1 cm. However, the first triangle is above the t -axis, meaning that displacement is positive, and hence to the right, while the second triangle is below the t -axis, meaning that displacement is negative, and hence to the left. The total displacement between t = 3 and t = 5 is: In other words, at t = 5 , the ant is in the same place as it was at t = 3. Curved Velocity vs. Time Graphs As with position vs. time graphs, velocity vs. time graphs may also be curved. Remember that regions with a steep slope indicate rapid acceleration or deceleration, regions with a gentle slope indicate small acceleration or deceleration, and the turning points have zero acceleration. Acceleration vs. Time Graphs After looking at position vs. time graphs and velocity vs. time graphs, acceleration vs. time graphs should not be threatening. Let’s look at the acceleration of our ant at another point in its dizzy day. Acceleration vs. time graphs give us information about acceleration and about velocity. SAT II Physics generally sticks to problems that involve a constant acceleration. In this graph, the ant is accelerating at 1 m/s 2 from t = 2 to t = 5 and is not accelerating between t = 6 and t = 7; that is, between t = 6 and t = 7 the ant’s velocity is constant. Calculating Change in Velocity Acceleration vs. time graphs tell us about an object’s velocity in the same way that velocity vs. time graphs tell us about an object’s displacement. The change in velocity in a given time interval is equal to the area under the graph during that same time interval. Be careful: the area between the graph and the t -axis gives the change in velocity, not the final velocity or average velocity over a given time period. What is the ant’s change in velocity between t = 2 and t = 5? Because the acceleration is constant during this time interval, the area between the graph and the t -axis is a rectangle of height 1 and length 3. The area of the shaded region, and consequently the change in velocity during this time interval, is 1 cm/s 2 · 3 s = 3 cm/s to the right. This doesn’t mean that the velocity at t = 5 is 3 cm/s; it simply means that the velocity is 3 cm/s greater than it was at t = 2. Since we have not been given the velocity at t = 2 , we can’t immediately say what the velocity is at t = 5. Summary of Rules for Reading Graphs You may have trouble recalling when to look for the slope and when to look for the area under the graph. Here are a couple handy rules of thumb: The slope on a given graph is equivalent to the quantity we get by dividing the y -axis by the x -axis. For instance, the y -axis of a position vs. time graph gives us displacement, and the x -axis gives us time. Displacement divided by time gives us velocity, which is what the slope of a position vs. time graph represents. The area under a given graph is equivalent to the quantity we get by multiplying the x -axis and the y -axis. For instance, the y -axis of an acceleration vs. time graph gives us acceleration, and the x -axis gives us time. Acceleration multiplied by time gives us the change in velocity, which is what the area between the graph and the x -axis represents. We can summarize what we know about graphs in a table: 
D2839560	http://cyberwest.com/15alwst/	Treasure in the San Luis Valley: The golden horde, part II	Treasure in the San Luis Valley: The golden horde, part IINovember 21, 1997By Christopher O’Brien The French expedition of 1790 Journeying down from the northern Rockies, exploratory French forays into the rarefied air of the Sangre de Cristos are said to have produced gold. A little-known story researched by Crestone author Jack Harlan concerns an ill-fated French-Canadian expedition into the southern Colorado Rockies, and is centered around a very identifiable northern San Luis Valley landmark.“While leaving the San Luis Valley by way of Poncha Pass, Round Mountain is skirted on the left. Here on Round Mountain an undetermined amount of gold nuggets [is] supposedly buried. There are several versions of the story. The most popular one is about a French Canadian trapper whose name has become lost through the years. . . .”A party of Canadians were trapping on the Snake River when they were discovered by American trappers, who attacked. In their hasty retreat, the Frenchmen lost their furs and traps to the Americans. Traveling south into western Colorado, one of the four found a gold nugget in the headwaters of the Gunnison River. Here they spent the next month successfully panning the gravel bars. Ute Indians discovered the Frenchmen and attacked them. In the running battle which lasted several days, three Frenchmen were killed. The fourth managed to escape over Cochetopa Pass (just west of Saguache). Sensing that his pursuers were closing in, he buried the gold on Round Mountain with the hopes of later returning for it. The Indians caught and killed the lone French-Canadian near the summit of Poncha Pass.”Starvation and bitter conditions killed off three of the men, who may have been eaten by the surviving two members. The treasure was never found, but the story endures, hundreds of years later. I travel on U. S. 285, which winds within feet of this little mountain, and on every trip north out of the San Luis Valley, I wonder ,,,One of Colorado’s most fabulous treasure legends is centered around a sizeable French expedition that journeyed to our area in the late 1700s. Setting out from a small French outpost near present-day Leavenworth, Kan., 300 men and 450 horses began the long trek toward the Rockies. The guides, officers, miners and laborers, following the course of the Platte River, explored and prospected several areas before reaching southern Colorado, and it is believed by some that the huge expedition may have superficially prospected unsuccessfully at Cripple Creek and other mining regions that later produced fabulous gold fields. Working their way south, they finally ended up near present-day Summitville, Colo. They made camp several miles east of Wolf Creek Pass and began prospecting the many creeks that flowed down the San Juan Mountains, just west of the San Luis Valley, hoping to find the elusive malleable metal. They allegedly struck the motherlode and buried the gold on what is now called Treasure Mountain. Most sources estimated the value at some $5 million, although one source estimated the cache as worth $33 million dollars. According to later reports, the gold was cached in three places, only known to the top officers of the expedition. A key chart was made of the entire area and kept by the officer in command. At first, upon their arrival at the Summitville area, the Native Indians seemed friendly. However, for some reason not presently known, the Indians became angry with the French. Perhaps the knowledge that the French were leaving with gold from their lands prompted them to attack the expedition as the French set out. In any event, an attack was mounted, and during the pitched battle, the gold was reburied and the French made new maps detailing where the buried gold was hidden. Very few French survived the battle. Estimates range from 17 to 35, but it is known the some of them did survive the Indian onslaught. To make matters worse, they were attacked again out on the Front Range, and only five men survived to continue the journey back to the French outpost in Kansas. Starvation and bitter conditions killed off three of the men, who may have been eaten by the surviving two members. The two men, more dead than alive, stumbled into the outpost and one of them died. The sole survivor, the expedition’s historian named “Le Blanc,” eventually traveled back to France with two copies of the treasure map. One was given to the French government, the other, naturally, he kept. Several maps have appeared claiming to lead to the re-buried treasure. There is much confusion at this part of the story. One version has the historian’s family mounting an expedition and returning to find the buried treasure. Another version has the French government mounting an expedition led by a relative of the historian. In any event, the second expedition, which numbered around 50 men, headed west to recover the gold. Stopping in Taos, N. M., they obtained the services of a guide who led them to the Summitville area. Allegedly, they searched the entire area for three years with no apparent luck. Then, the guide returned to Taos alone, claiming the entire expedition had again been wiped out by the Indians. The locals were suspicious of him because he was the sole survivor. He was tried for murder, but was acquitted. It is said that his trial was the last Mexican trial held in United States territory. Some theorists claim the whole story was contrived by the French who secretly found the gold and returned to France with it. The guide was paid to be a “patsy” and promised a fortune to return to Taos with the untrue story of a massacre. This scenario seems unlikely, although later, French equipment was found among the Indians. Another version has the guide spending years trying in vain to locate the lost treasure of Treasure Mountain. Several maps have appeared claiming to lead to the re-buried treasure. A man named William Yule claimed he had a copy of the original and searched the entire western side of the valley – all the way north to Saguache, with no apparent success. Another colorful prospector named Asa Poor obtained the map from Yule, and with two partners, was able to locate several landmarks leading to the caches, but was not able to finally locate the hidden French gold. One of Poor’s partners, named Montroy, retained possession of the map, but it disappeared several years later. Eureka? After much digging, and a bit of luck, I’ve located and talked with several knowledgeable “treasure hunters.” I began hearing stories of “treasure maps.” Then, in 1993, I was introduced to a amiable man I’ll call Tomas Ortiz (not his real name). Tomas’ wife is the daughter of the patriarch of the treasure-hunting family. At one point in our initial conversation, he casually told me that his brother-in-law has an authentic “treasure map written in French,” and his family are “direct descendents of Le Blanc.” He told me, “for three generations” they have been quietly searching for the fabled lost French gold. Their claim is backed up with, what appears to be, a genuine map, drawn by the harried second expedition before they unsuccessfully tried to escape with their lives. Could this actually be the real Le Blanc map? Their map and story are impressive. After searching for decades, family members have slowly and painstakingly located seven out of eight landmarks and clues carved in rock that are mentioned in the map. The most important eighth and final clue has eluded their efforts for years. Then, in 1993, their lucked turned. Or did it? As Ortiz placed the last candle at the far end of the tunnel, a “large rattlesnake” lunged out of the gloom and narrowly missed striking him. Thirty-year-old Tomas happened to be hunting elk, in the mountains southeast of Del Norte, Colo., on an overcast late fall morning in 1993. The clouds loomed threatening, and a cold hard rain began to spit. The pale pre-dawn gloom cast faint detail to the surrounding vegetation, and Ortiz looked around for shelter from the rain. He spotted a small 3-foot opening in the ground, hidden by some underbrush, and after removing some loose rocks, he squeezed through the opening and peered into the darkness. He clicked on his flashlight and was surprised to find he had entered a 5-foot-high, 4-foot-wide tunnel, obviously man-made. Ortiz cautiously explored down the gentle-sloping narrow passageway, and after wriggling about 20 feet into the hillside, his way was blocked by an apparent underground landslide. Shining his light around the dim narrow passageway, he spied a carving on the rock wall next to the cave-in. Quite aware of his in-law’s long quest, he was thrilled by what he saw. It was the long-lost eighth clue that according to the treasure map indicated the hidden location of the fabled French treasure. Completely forgetting the wily elk herd he had been stalking, he excitedly rushed back to town to tell the family of his fortuitous find. The following day, Tomas led an expedition back to the tunnel. Members of the party, consisting of 20 family members, began eagerly excavating the cave-in, and after several grueling hours of hard work, they extended the tunnel an additional 12 feet into the mountainside. Thirty-two feet in, they encountered a large boulder that appeared to have been purposely rolled into place to seal the rest of the passageway. By this time, the sun had set and the elated group gathered at the entrance and took a break as twilight approached from the east. Undaunted by the approaching night, Tomas lined the length of the passageway with a dozen equally spaced unlit candles. The ensuing events allegedly occurred “in a matter of minutes.”As Ortiz placed the last candle at the far end of the tunnel, a “large rattlesnake” lunged out of the gloom and narrowly missed striking him. He frantically scrambled breathlessly back out to the entrance followed by a boiling “swarm of bats” that began pouring out of the hillside. Uncharacteristically, the small mammals began squeaking and diving aggressively at the surprised party. What they claim happened seconds later quickly erased the elation and excitement of the expedition. According to Tomas, as he knelt down to light the first candle at the entrance to the tunnel, the “candle at the far end” of the passageway inexplicably flared on by itself! The stunned group knowing no one was in the tunnel stared at each other in horror. “At that instant,” out of the gloom, a “huge owl” dive-bombed the shocked party within inches of their heads. That was the last straw. As if chased by the devil himself, the terrified group grabbed their children, raced down the hillside, piled into their cars and, as Tomas put it, they “got the hell outta there!”Further research has uncovered information that suggests the Ute Indians may have acquired some of the French gold during the running battle, and hid it down near the mouth of the Rio Grande Canyon. As of this writing, the family has obtained the Colorado state treasure rights to legally enter the cave and claim whatever treasure is located there. I have been invited along to document the event. Dead Man’s Cave Another fascinating account is one of the few that have actually produced verified gold to bolster the lucky finder’s claims. However, this is one of those that got away. It’s probably still out there. The Fairplay Flume, in 1880, and The Denver Post have both published articles about this story told by three prospectors – E. J. Oliver, S. J. Harkman and H. A. Melton. In 1880, the three men had been prospecting 2 miles north of what become known as Dead Man Camp, (about 8 miles south of where I live) The sky threatened, and before long the three men found themselves caught in a furious blizzard. Knowing travel is difficult, at best, in the rugged Sangres under ideal weather conditions, they found shelter underneath a convenient ledge near the mouth of a canyon. Looking across the canyon, one of the men noticed what appeared to be a small opening in the shear rock wall. They made their way to the opening and made several crude torches. The opening was very narrow and less than 4-feet high and extended into the cliff about 10 feet, before it opened up into a large 20-foot-long vault. Shining their torches around, Oliver found the first of five skeletons scattered around the dusty, dark cavern. After exploring the cavern, they found several tight passageways extending into the gloom of the mountain. They chose one to explore. It led into the mountain and opened up into a larger vault-like chamber. Near the far end, Melton noticed what appeared to be shelves carved into the side of the western wall. He lit the area and saw some peculiar-looking stones stacked on the shelf. He picked one up; surprised at its heavy weight, and brought it back to his partners to look at. Imagine their delight when the “stones” turned out to be crude bars of gold! In their excitement, thinking the opening would be easy to mark and find again, the men gathered up only five of the bars, and headed over the pass to Silver Cliff, in the Wet Mountain Valley. The bars proved to be worth $900 apiece, and the men became instant celebrities. Although asked by many, the men steadfastly refused to divulge the actual location and secretly made plans to return to Dead Man’s Cave. Search these vast areas hard and deep enough and you may be surprised at what you’ll find, but I suggest you tread lightly . . .“The men slipped off in the spring. But they never found the Dead Man Cave. Thought had thought it would be easy, but on their return they found so many places that looked like the area in which the caves were found. In fact, practically the entire area seemed strange to them. They went back frequently. Many others went back frequently. Nobody found anything.” (The Fairplay Flume)Colorado has an interesting series of “treasure rights,” which can be obtained for the right to look, find and keep treasure found in specific deeded locations. I couldn’t help but wonder, who owned the treasure rights for the area around the Dead Man’s Treasure? A simple listing of the San Luis Valley and Huerfano area’s lost mines and treasures is, to say the least, impressive. The following is a sampling of south-central Colorado and north-central New Mexico legends and accounts from the seminal works, “Lost Mines and Buried Treasures of the West,” by Thomas Probert (the University of California Press, 1977); “Treasure of the Sangre De Cristos,” by Arthur Campa, (The University of Oklahoma Press, 1963); the voluminous “Directory of Buried or Sunken Treasures and Lost Mines of the United States” (True Treasure Publications, 1971); the compelling “Treasure Tales of the Rockies,” by Thomas Penfield (Sage Books, 1961); the northern San Luis Valley’s “Post Marks and Places,” by Jack Harlan (Golden Bell Press); “Colorado’s Lost Mines and Buried Treasure,” by Caroline Bancroft (Bancroft Booklets, 1961), and various other sources. From the Huerfano/Spanish Peaks region: Alex Cobsky’s Lost Mine near Silver Mountain, northeast of La Veta Pass The Arapaho Princess Treasure, near the Spanish Peaks Caverna del Oro, on Marble Mountain George Skinner’s Lost Mine, on Horn Peak Mountain The Green Lost Mine, west of the town of Red Wing, Colo.

"Longitude Latitude Geographic Coordinate System Altitude Geolocation Geography What is the difference between latitude, longitude and altitude?26 Answers Xavier Daull, studied at National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts , France Answered Dec 20, 2015Originally Answered: What is the difference between latitude and longitude? Longitude and latitude are like X/Y coordinates (absciss, ordinate) but on the Earth sphere. So any place on Earth can be pinpointed using its latitude (North/South value) and longitude (West/East value) coordinates. A point's coordinate is measured in degrees because it is the angle betwheen the agreed reference (Equator for latitude / Greenwich for longitude) and this point, viewed from the center of Earth.http://modernsurvivalblog.com/wp... Latitude: it is the North/South value of a point on Earth. Any point on the Equator's circle is of latitude 0°, the top north is 90° North, the top south is 90° South. Circles parallels to the Equator are of the same latitude. Longitude: it is the West/East value of a point on Earth. Longitudes are lines going from south pole to north pole. Greenwich is on longitude 0° and any point on the line going from North pole to the South pole via Greenwich is on longitude 0°. Latitudes and longitudes are perpandicular each other on the famous Mercator projection (an earth projection is a way of drawing a sphere on a flat map): Eiffel tour latitude is 48° North (from Equator) and its longitude is 02° East (from Greenwich). To be more accurate we usually use seconds (') and minutes ('') so Eiffel tour is: 48° 51' 30"" North, 02° 17' 40"" East.79.3k Views · View Upvoters Your response is private.

What is the difference of longitude and latitude? Ask New Question Shivani Chaturvedi, Research Fellow at Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research Updated Dec 12, 2015 · Author has 61 answers and 132.8k answer views Originally Answered: What is the difference between latitude and longitude? Latitudes also known as parallels of latitude and meridians also known as meridians of longitude are the imaginary lines that run on the earth's surface which are used to find the exact location of a place on the globe (or map) and it's time zone. Parallels of latitude: These lines circle the earth from north pole and south pole. Equator is the longest latitude which divides the earth between northern hemisphere and southern hemispher. These are measured in degrees. Equator is latitude of 0°. The latitudes in the north area numbered with °N with it. The latitudes in the south are numbered with °S with it. Latitudes are from 0° to 90° N and 0° to 90°S. Latitudes are not of the same length. Other important latitudes are Tropic of cancer at 23.5°N, Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5°S,Article circle at 66.5°N, Antarctic circle 66.5°S, North pole 90°N, South pole at 90°S. Meridians of longitude: These lines are drawn joining north pole and south pole. Unlike latitudes, longitudes are of same length. These are measured in °W or°E. Prime meridian is the most important longitude at 0°. This longitude divides the earth in eastern hemisphere and western hemisphere. The lines lying on the east of prime meridian are named as °E and those to the west of prime meridian are measured as °W. There are 360 longitudes. But 180°E and 180°W are not the same lines. Longitudes along with helping in finding location also helps to know the time zone. For each meridian you travel, the time differs by 4 minutes. So, once you know the latitude and longitude of a place you can easily locate it on globe or map!30.3k Views · View Upvoters Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date? Neeraj Patralekh, Another Engineer, Quora lover Updated Mar 19, 2018Latitude and Longitude is nothing but a coordinate system. Let's discuss one by one. What is coordinate system. Location of an object can't be decided unless we take any reference point. Suppose two person stand on a ground we can't say what is their position if we don't measure distance from any other point. Basically there are two type of coordinate system first one 2D like on a piece of paper we draw some point. Here any point is defined as position from X-axis and Y-axis. And other one is 3D like a point inside a room But what if we want to get location of any object on Earth's surface. We can't use 2D or 3D Co-ordinate system because earth is neither a flat nor in a cubical shape. Earth is a spherical in shape, so in order to get a position on earth we have find a different co-ordinate system. In this geographical co-ordinate system X-axis will replace Latitude and Y-axis will replace Longitude. Now from above this image we can define Latitude are those imaginary line which are parallel to Equatorial and Longitude are those imaginary line which are perpendicular to Latitude. There is another significance of these line Latitude explain the temperature range on Earth and Longitude explain Time zone. Now finally your third question what is altitude. Altitude is height or distance of an object from sea level.1.2k Views · View Upvoters Shailesh Latkar, Geography optional in CSEAnswered Feb 8, 2017 · Author has 105 answers and 89.9k answer views In lay man terms : Latitudes are the horizontal lines which demarcates earth's climatic variations for eg. 0° to 30°N S latitude roughly its equator the temperate the torrid then frigid zones . Longitude are vertical lines which demarcates time zones because of apparent movement of earth ,so at every longitude there's a time difference of 4 minutes as 360° earth divided by 24hrs . Longitude and latitude together are useful for specifying location and its various attributes. Altitude is the distance measured from Mean Sea Level vertically upwards . For eg.

Original Question: What is the difference between latitude and longitude? There have been some good, and very detailed, answers already given, but it all comes down to the fact that latitude is the measurement of how for north or south of the Equator a place is, and longitude is how far east or west of the Greenwich Meridian (or Prime Meridian) a place is. The imaginary lines of latitude run round the Earth horizontally and parallel to the Equator, whilst the imaginary lines of longitude run vertically from pole to pole. This combination enables any point on the Earth to be precisely located. A good description of the difference and how geographic coordinates are measured and used is to be found here - Where Am I?

What is the difference between them? You can get lots of good answers for this question by posting it in any search engine on the internet. A good answer is here. The following picture shows latitudes and longitudes on the earth’s surface a little better. ( www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/images/globe6.jpg)The differences you can see in the picture. Longitude circles follow the earth’s circumference from North to South and they are all the same size as the earth’s circumference. They are all centered on the center of the earth and they converge towards the poles. Their planes are all parallel to the earth’s rotation axis and contain the rotation axis. Latitude circles are drawn in an East-West direction and they are all parallel to the equator, which is a circle along the circumference of the earth with the earth’s center as its center. The plane of the equator is perpendicular to the rotation axis of the earth and so are the planes of all the latitude circles. The equator is the largest latitude circle and all the other latitude circles get smaller towards the poles. because their centers are on the rotation axis and not at the center of the earth. The units are in angular units, normally degrees, at the center of the earth. The angles for latitude refer to the plane of the equator, North or South, while the angles for longitude refer to the plane of the zero longitude, which is very close to the Greenwich longitude. Longitudes are also referred to as Meridians and latitudes as parallels.5k Views · View Upvoters Deepak Kumar, works at Maruti Suzuki India Limited Answered Mar 10, 2018Originally Answered: What is the difference between longitude, latitude and altitude?

Exactly the same as is shown by the two sides of a right angled triangle that form the right angle. Both latitude and longitude are imaginary lines drawn around the earth based on an arbitrary system where zero line of longitude passes through Greenwich, England, and runs north to south (or vice versa), and zero line of latitude passes around the center of the earth (so is the longest line of latitude) running from east to west (or vice versa) and is called the equator. Subsequent lines of longitude are labelled in degrees west or east from the line through Greenwich, based on an imaginary protractor set horizontally east to west through the center of the earth. Subsequent lines of latitude are labelled in degrees from the equator based on an imaginary protractor set through the center of the earth between north and south poles. Lines of latitude and longitude intersect at 90 degrees because that is the angle at which east-west lines intersect with north-south lines.231 Views Prabh Rangi, Independent Dharmic Peace Researcher (2018-present)Answered Jan 23, 2018Originally Answered: What is the difference between latitude and longitude?latitude is east-west longitude is north-south Equator is centre - and divides world into Southern and Northern Hemispheres.

D806663	https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/feb/13/shopping.familyandrelationships1	How to buy an engagement ring	"Life and style How to buy an engagement ring Buying an engagement ring is a scary business. In the second of our guides, Leo Hickman offers the inside knowledge you need Wed 13 Feb 2002 11.28 EST11.28 EST159The basics If you are planning to join the 75% of British men who buy their ""special lady"" a diamond engagement ring, you will want to pay close attention to the following advice. This is not something you want to get wrong. Not only are you about to part with a substantial amount of money (all women know the engagement-ring mantra about the fiancé waving goodbye to at least a month's salary), but you are also about to purchase an object that will be a permanent symbol of the most important relationship of your life. There are universally agreed rules on buying diamonds. Follow them and you should avoid the pitfalls. First, a geology lesson: diamonds are 99.95% pure crystallised carbon and can be extremely old - one to three billion years old, in fact. They are the hardest naturally occurring substance known and are formed beneath the Earth's surface when crystals of diamond occur in volcano feed-pipes. When volcanoes erode down, they release diamonds from their feed-pipes into layers of gravel which are later mined. However, due to the relative rarity of this natural process, diamond mines are found in just a handful of sites around the world. In rough form, diamonds are shipped to the world's cutting centres to be shaped and polished before being set as jewellery. It is the hardness, brilliance and sparkle that emerges during this process that transforms them into a girl's best friend. Now for a quick history lesson, as you may be curious to know where the fashion began. Legend dictates that in 1477, a lovestruck Austrian, Archduke Maximilian, came up with a gem of an idea: why not give Mary of Burgundy a diamond ring to celebrate their imminent engagement? He placed it on the third finger of her left hand - the finger believed by ancient Egyptians to have a vein that led straight to the heart. It is not known whether the marriage was a success, but you don't need to worry about that. The Four Cs So now that you know why you are buying an engagement ring made with a diamond, you can familiarise yourself with the ""Four Cs"" - cut, colour, clarity and carat. All must be considered equally when comparing diamonds, but more than any other factor, according to Tiffany and Co, it is how the diamond is cut that will determine its defining characteristic. Cut: As the only characteristic of a diamond not influenced by nature, the cut is open to mistakes and bad practices. Cut a diamond incorrectly and the defining sparkle will be compromised. It is how the 57 or 58 facets (the tiny planes cut on the diamond's surface) are angled and sized that dictate how light reflects and exits the diamond, an effect known as its ""fire"". Make the cuts too deep or too shallow and the diamond will be less brilliant. The cut will also determine the shape of the diamond. The most common shape is the round cut, but others include the emerald, the pear, the marquise, the princess, the oval and the heart shape. Ask to see all of these shapes, if only in a picture, to make sure you have covered all your options. Colour: The most valuable and rare colour is white, that is to say, colourless. Jewellers grade absolutely colourless diamonds with a ""D"". The scale moves up to ""Z"" (don't ask what happened to A, B and C) and, between these two extremes, diamonds will display subtle coloured tones. Diamonds with a very strong and distinct colour are extremely rare and are called fancies. Clarity: Many people get unnecessarily hung up over the clarity of a diamond. Look into most diamonds with a jeweller's loupe (magnifying eyeglass) and you will see small ""inclusions"", also known as ""nature's fingerprints"". They look like small clouds or feathers but are usually invisible to the naked eye. Inclusions can affect the diamond's fire, but they also make your diamond unique and shouldn't always be seen as a fault. Why worry too much about something you can't see, anyway? As long as the stone is graded SI1 (Slightly Included 1) or better (best and most expensive is IF, or Internally Flawless; worst is I3, or Imperfect 3), you should be all right. Carat: The weight, and thus the size, of a diamond is measured by carat. A carat is equal to 0.2gm, or 200mgm. A carat is divided into 100 smaller units called points. For example, three-quarters of a carat is 75 points. The average size of most engagement-ring diamonds is somewhere between one carat and half a carat. Do not confuse carats with karats, the unit of purity for gold. Any reputable jeweller will know about the four Cs and be prepared to talk you through them all without prompt when displaying diamonds. But if you don't wish to place your trust entirely in a jeweller, you should request a ""cert stone"" - a diamond that has been assessed, graded and coded with a laser by an independent gemmological laboratory. The type of certificate is important, as not all are universally recognised. The most internationally recognised are issued by GIA (the Gemmological Institute of America). Other popular certificates include HRD, IGL, EGL and AGS (see Diamond Certificate Issuers, right). The fee for a grading certificate varies depending upon the carat of your diamond, but for exact prices, contact a specific laboratory. And do not be afraid of organising your own certificate rather than accepting the jeweller's recommendation. Another good reason for getting cert stones is to guard against buying ""diamonds"" made with substitutes. Zircon, white sapphire, topaz and quartz are natural minerals that can be nearly colourless and used as natural diamond substitutes. Synthetic substitutes include cubic zirconia and moissanite. All these are sold as legitimately cheap alternatives, but be aware that they are sometimes, albeit rarely, passed off as real diamonds. Diamonds can also be artificially treated, most commonly by being fracture filled, irradiated or laser treated. All of this is legal, as long as it is disclosed to the buyer, but if you want a ""real"" and untreated diamond, guard yourself against terms such as ""clarity enhanced"". How much should I pay? This is the fifth C - cost. Obviously, how much you spend is a personal matter, but you will no doubt hear that one to two months' salary is the norm. There is one point to say about this: it seems to stem from De Beers' publicity machine. Spend whatever you like and can realistically afford. Remember that De Beers has a near monopoly on the diamond industry and has an interest in what you spend. And scotch any thoughts that a diamond ring is a sound investment. A retailer can mark up a new diamond ring by up to 100%, and it could lose half its value the moment that you leave the shop. Even with a diamond bought at the virtually wholesale rates of London's jewellery centre, Hatton Garden, it could take more than five years to regain its price. Give her what she wants It is all well and good knowing your IFs from your I3s, but if you don't buy her the right type of engagement ring, all is lost. Perhaps the most important piece of advice is never to surprise her with a diamond ring, and not to buy something according to your own taste. One way to find out what she likes is to take a cue from the style of jewellery that she already owns. Does she prefer modern or traditional? Does she favour white gold, yellow gold, two-tone (white and yellow gold) or platinum (currently the most popular metal for engagement rings)? Also, how does she react to other women's engagement rings? Does she ever express an interest in a particular style when flicking through fashion magazines? The chances are, however, after a quick consultation with her girlfriends and female relatives - if you can trust them with your secret - that you will glean a fairly accurate picture of her likes and dislikes. She will probably prefer a classic diamond solitaire - which account for 76% of all sales of engagement rings - but there are many ways to present a quality stone on a ring. Would she like a Tiffany-style solitaire in which prongs hold the diamond high? Or perhaps a basket setting, or some other low-head style? Without doubt, though, you should involve her in the decision. It may run counter to your romantic instincts, but she will thank you.1: Buying from a jeweller There are alternatives to buying an engagement ring from a jeweller. You could, perhaps, consider buying an antique ring from a shop or auction, but if you want a new ring it is best to visit as many jewellers as possible to gauge what is available on the market. It is worth remembering that major high-street jewellers are inevitably pricier than London's jewellery centre at Hatton Garden, so if you can visit there - many different shops, all in one street - so much the better. Consider, too, that jewellers are busiest in the run-up to Christmas and before Valentine's Day. August is traditionally their slowest month, so it may be the best time to ask for a better deal. Make sure you run this checklist through your head every time you visit a shop:· Does the store have a long-standing and solid local reputation?· Do the staff evidently possess a sound gemmological knowledge? Watch out for gratuitous and unexplained jargon.· Is the shop willing to sell you diamonds with a well-known gemmological certificate? If so, make sure you keep the original rather than a copy.· Is the shop a member of a trade association? If so, which one?· Will the shop present a detailed receipt with your purchase? This is key to any possible insurance claim or future repair.· Does the shop appear to have a busy repairs service? (A good indication of customer trust. )· Exactly which warranties and guarantees does the shop offer? Read them closely.· Will the salesperson let you examine the diamond through a loupe and on a white background? If diamonds are viewed on a black background, the eye's perception of colour is hindered.2: On the web Buying diamond rings via the internet is not recommended because you should view the diamonds in person so that you can cover all of the above details. If you do choose to do so, only buy cert stones and pay special attention to the delivery terms and possible tax and duty charges if buying from a foreign-based site. But the internet does offer you a chance to do your homework. The following sites will all let you gauge what styles and prices are currently available.www.thediamondshop.co.ukwww.approveddiamonds.comwww.jewellerywebshop.co.ukwww.cooldiamonds.comwww.nydex.comwww.diasource.comwww.theofennell.comwww.mondera.comwww.jewellerywebshop.co.uk3: Only for the brave If you are really on the hunt for a good deal, then you could try some of the companies trying to break with the traditional supply chain of the diamond industry. One such company is the mining firm Rex Mining Diamond Corporation, which has a website intended to bypass the retail route and sell wholesale to the public. The address is www.rexgems.com Alternatively, try the Hatton Garden wholesalers who normally only sell direct to retailers. In most cases they will not have any recognisable street presence, just a bell to ring, but will sell loose diamonds up to 50% cheaper than available on the high street. They won't have time for people who aren't serious and probably won't be interested in delivering much of a sales spiel, but if you know exactly what you are after, give them a try. Contact the jewellery trade associations for names and numbers to try. What else do I need to know?

Unfortunately, the locations of some of the planet's key diamond mines happen to coincide with the locations of some of the world's bitterest conflicts, and those in control of the gems don't always invest their profits ethically. Sierra Leone is perhaps the most infamous hot spot at present, but the diamond trade has been linked by the UN to troubles in other African states including Rwanda, Angola, Liberia, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, Uganda, Ghana, Namibia, Mali, Zambia, Burkina Faso, Guinea and the Ivory Coast. The UN has also criticised Switzerland, not a diamond-producing nation but a diamond free-trade area, for its role as a transit point for almost half the rough diamonds entering Britain. Antwerp, the ""diamond capital of the world"", is also criticised for ""facilitating"" the trade in so-called ""blood diamonds"". As consumers, we are helpless when it comes to establishing the true origin of a cut diamond. ""After the diamond is cut,"" says Stephen Kennedy, the laboratory director at the Gemmological Association and Gem Testing Laboratory of Great Britain, ""there is no way of knowing the origin of source. ""Kennedy's only advice is to be suspicious of dealers who suggest otherwise. The UN's advice is to apply consumer power by asking about the source of origin. That way the message might finally get across to an industry badly in need of better self-regulation.· The next in the How to Buy series, on bicycles, will be published on February 27.

Answer by Oldog Confidence votes 6.8KVoltage measures the relative amount of energy that will be carried by the electrical charge in a circuit. It is expressed by the equation V = W/q where W is the energy in Joules and q is the charge in coulombs. In a 1.5 volt energy cell each coulomb of charge has 1.5 Joules of energy; in a 12 volt battery each coulomb of charge has 12 Joules of energy. Interestingly, voltage exists even when there is no current (the charge is not moving). A 1.5 v cell or 12 v battery has voltage even when it is sitting unused in its package. it is measured by connecting up a circuit. to get more information high schoolers, look in the CXC integrated science and turn to page 174 and read to get a proper understanding. i trust that this will help. reading is a good exercise to the brain.11 people found this useful Was this answer useful?

D1718750	http://healthcare.findlaw.com/patient-rights/can-doctors-give-medical-information-to-others-without-permission.html	Can Doctors Ever Give My Personal Medical Information to Others Without My Permission?	Can Doctors Ever Give My Personal Medical Information to Others Without My Permission? Download article as a PDFInformation in medical records is considered highly private and sensitive. Medical ethics rules, state laws, and the federal law known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), generally require doctors and their staff to keep patients' medical records confidential, unless the patient allows the doctor's office to disclose them. However, there are a variety of circumstances under which a doctor may share the information in medical records and personal medical information without the express permission of the patient. The following are some examples. The Doctor and/or Patient Needs Help If the patient has suffered some traumatic injury and cannot make medical decisions for him or herself, the doctor may discuss the patient's medical information with that patient's next of kin. The family member will often need this information so that she can make an informed decision about the next steps in medical treatment. If the patient has a living will or a healthcare power of attorney, the doctor may only discuss the patient's condition with the people named in those documents. Even in cases not involving traumatic injuries, under HIPAA, doctors can use and share patients' information and records with other health care providers as necessary for the patients' health and treatment. They may also discuss a patient's condition with family, relatives, and friends that the patient identifies as being involved in his or her healthcare, unless the patient objects. However, health care providers generally cannot share personal medical information and records with providers who are not involved in the patient’s care, unless all identifying information is removed. The Government Requires It The government and legal system usually respect patients' privacy and do not require doctors to disclose personal medical information. However, there are a few basic data points doctors must report. Doctors must file birth and death certificates. They must also report certain diseases they've treated over a certain time period so that the government can monitor the nation's health, although these disclosures do not usually include the patients' names. Doctors can also use your health information if necessary to protect public health, with one example being to report a flu outbreak. Doctors must also report suspected cases of child abuse, even though the child or her parent did not expressly authorize the disclosure. Similarly, if a doctor thinks her patient's mental state will cause him to be a danger to himself or others, she may report this in order to prevent harm to innocent parties. The Patient Makes His Health an Issue in Court If the patient brings a personal injury or workers' compensation claim, in which his health is a major issue in the case, the doctor may come to court and testify about the patient's injuries. However, if the patient's health is not necessary to the case's resolution, the doctor usually cannot be forced to testify. Medical privacy laws are varied and complex, particularly since they are addressed by both state and federal laws. If you are concerned that your personal medical information or records were improperly disclosed, it may be a good idea to contact a local Health Care Law attorney. 
D260946	http://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/cucumb.html	.	"Vine Crops Search Clove Garden SAFARI Users General & History Using Cucumbers - flavor & Texture Varieties Health Considerations - and nutrition Links - to information on Squash General& History Cucumbers are probably native to northern India and were cultivated there and in Western Asia well over 3000 years ago. They were much favored by the Romans who spread them to other parts of Europe but they didn't get to England until about the 14th century and have to be grown in hothouses there. Cucumbers arrived in the Americas in the early 16th century. When they arrived in China and Japan is uncertain but is thought to be somewhat later than their arrival in Rome. The durable ""green blimp"" cucumbers we are accustomed to in the U. S. are a relatively recent development. In earlier times cucumbers were similar to the Persian and often thinner and longer. Besides the fruits, which botanists call a ""modified berry"", young shoots and leaves of the vine can be cooked and eaten as greens. Using Cucumbers There are two locations of flavor in cucumbers, the skin and the seed mass. Sample an over-ripe cucumber and you'll find the slightly yellow seed mass to have a stronger and quite distinctly cucumber flavor. Personally I don't mind that flavor, in moderation, but some people don't like it. You'll find many sources telling you English cucumbers have more flavor than the standard garden cucumber. Peel them both and you'll find the garden cuke more flavorful, it's just that the English doesn't have to be peeled and the thick bitter skin of the garden variety does. A better compromise is to use Persian or Japanese cucumbers which have thin non-bitter skin but enough seed mass to be more flavorful than the English. Unfortunately they don't keep and have to be used within a few of days. Kerbys are midway between in seediness, bitterness and toughness of skin and also are not waxed.for best flavor the seed mass should be included in recipes if possible. This is not possible in cases where the liquid will bleed out and dilute the recipe - then the seeds must be scooped out. When I do this I scrape the seeds into a bowl, add some salt and eat the seed mass as a snack while I cook. Recipes that call for seeding cukes usually presume the big ""green blimps"" but if you use Persians or Japanese cucumbers you probably won't have to seed them (or peel them) and flavor will be better. Varieties Cucumber (standard issue) - [Garden Cucumber, Market Cucumber, Green Blimp, Cucumis sativus ]These cucumbers are grown on fully functional vines with both male and female flowers so they have a large seed mass and plenty of seeds. Consequently they have more real cucumber flavor than seedless varieties. The skin is fairly tough and bitter so they are almost always peeled. Since they'll be peeled anyway growers seal them with a heavy coating of wax for longer storage - they'll last at least two weeks in the fridge. You do want to peel them because you don't know who sponsored the FDA studies certifying that wax as ""edible"". Size varies widely but the photo specimen is 9-1/4 inches long, 2-3/8 inches diameter and weighed 1-1/4 pounds. A more typical supermarket size would likely be 12 ounces to a pound but 2 pounders are often available at produce markets. The cut one was picked quite young so the seeds are immature and the seed mass is relatively small. When cucumbers become over-ripe they start to yellow, the seeds start to harden and the seed mass gets a stronger flavor. Armenian Cucumber Not a cucumber, it's a Melon . Beijing Cucumber - [Peking Cucumber]Though it looks sort of like an overgrown European cucumber with tiny white spine spots all over it, the Beijing is not ""seedless"". It can, in fact have a higher proportion of seed mass than a garden cucumber does, improving the flavor over seedless varieties. The skin is very thin and they are not waxed so you don't have to peel them, but it means they will spoil quickly so use them right away. The larger photo specimen was 19 inches long, 2 inches diameter and weighed 1 pound 6 ounces. So far these are available in only a few of the East / Southeast Asian markets in Los Angeles and prices are still a quite high - about US $1.19/# while Persians can be had here for 69 cents/# and gardens for less than 25 cents/# in season. Dosakai - [Lemon Cucumber, Cucumis. sativus ]These cucumbers get their name from being about the size and shape of a lemon, and bright yellow varieties are popular in India. The photo specimens are green with whole or broken stripes, the variety grown in Southern California. They are seldom available even in Indian markets and are sold at a high price so they're more a curiosity than practical ingredient right now. These cucumbers are sweeter than other varieties and do not need to be peeled. They go well in salads but in India they are most often cooked as an ingredient in recipes or made into pickles and chutneys. English Cucumber - [#4593, Hothouse Cucumber, Burpless Cucumber, Seedless Cucumber, European Cucumber, Cucumis sativus ]This is a variety of the European Cucumber selected for large size and straightness. This makes them more economical to shrink wrap in plastic to extend their shelf life. The photo specimen was fairly typical at 14-1/2 inches long, 1-3/4 inches diameter at the thickest point and weighed 14 ounces. See European Cucumber for all further details. European Cucumber - [English Cucumber, Hothouse Cucumber, Burpless Cucumber, Seedless Cucumber, Cucumis sativus ]These cucumbers are grown on vines that produce only female flowers. Since the flowers have no way to get knocked up they produce seedless fruit. Seeds are expensive because to produce them rare vines that have one or more male flowers must be found. Growing the vines take special care and even in California they have to be grown in hothouses or screened buildings. Care must be taken that bees and other pollinating insects cannot access the flowers. Should a bee that has visited sexually functional cucumber plants outside get in, seeds will will develop. These cucumbers are never waxed because with so thin a skin these cukes are normally not peeled. This makes them highly perishable due to dehydration and consequent rot. Southern California high volume produce markets sell them and call them ""European Cucumber"". Larger straighter varieties are shrink wrapped in plastic for longer shelf life so they can be shipped to distant markets and are called English Cucumbers. The larger of the photo specimens was 13 inches long (uncurled) 1-3/4 inches diameter at the thickest point and weighed 10 ounces. Typical shrink wrapped specimens are a little bigger but generally weigh less than a pound. Details and Cooking. Gherkin - True - [West Indian Gherkin, Bur Cucumber, Gooseberry Gourd (English); Concombre Antillais, Cornichon des Antilles, Ti-concombre, Macissis (French); Pepino das Antilhas, Cornichão das Antillas, Machiche, Maxixé (Portuguese); Cucumis anguria]True Gherkins are a small non- sativa cucumber native to southern Africa from Zaire south to Botswana and naturalized in Madagascar, but are best known for cultivation in the Caribbean region. The non-bitter less spiky varieties developed in the Caribbean have been reintroduced to Africa and are now cultivated there. The plant is also grown in Brazil and other parts of South America. In the Caribbean and South America fruit is picked quite young, as it gets bitter and more spiky when much over 1-1/2 inches long. It is generally pickled, but is also cooked as a vegetable, particularly in soups. In Africa, leaves of the bitter varieties are used as greens, and some of the non-bitter varieties are pickled. In the U. S. this plant is grown in gardens for private use in Florida and exists in isolated patches as weeds in several other states including a county each in California and Texas. It is not considered an aggressive weed and seeds are available from suppliers. Photo © source and licensing lost. Gherkin - Cucumber - [Cornichon (French), Cucumis sativa ]Any tiny immature cucumber used for pickling, generally less than three inches long. Since few people have ever seen a real gherkin this naming has been a successful subterfuge. India has become a major grower and pickler of these cucumbers taking advantage of low labor rates but this industry is ecologically questionable and there have been contract abuses as well. The photo specimens are from Bulgaria with the largest measuring 2-7/8 inch long, 7/8 inch diameter and weighing 5/8 ounce. Gherkin - Indian It's a gourd - see Tindora . Hothouse Cucumber - see European, Persian and Mediterranean Cucumbers. In most regions it means specifically the ""English"" packaging of the European cucumber. Japanese Cucumber - [ Cucumus sativus ]Not seedless but with much fewer seeds than garden cucumbers, Japanese cucumbers are sold unwaxed. They are generally dark green with bumpy skins and may have white spine dots. They are similar to the Persian cucumber but much larger and most varieties are sturdy enough to be grown in open fields in California.. There are a number of varieties ranging up to three feet long and 2 inches in diameter but the most popular are about 8 inches long and very straight. Millions are grown in Southern California but they are rarely seen in markets because our thousands of sushi bars (most of which, to the distress of the Japanese, are run by Koreans now) consume the crop. Photo ""borrowed"" from Kitazawa Seed Co., Oakland CA. Kirby Cucumber - [Liberty Cucumber, Pickle, Cucumus sativus ]You can't pickle a waxed cucumber so these are never waxed. That means you can eat them skins-on but also they will spoil quickly - even in the fridge they'll start getting slimy in just a few days. Peeled they have a little less flavor than the Green Blimps because the seed mass is so immature - they're often picked so young they look almost ""seedless"". These vary greatly in size depending on how young they're picked. The largest of the photo specimens was 5-1/4 inches long, 2 inches in diameter and weighed 7-3/8 ounces. The smallest was 3-1/2 inches long, 1-3/8 inch diameter at the big end and weighed 1-3/4 ounces. The skin is a bit tougher than that of the seedless varieties (though not bitter) so for some uses you may wish to peel them, or they may be partially peeled to decorative effect. They do well in salads and for cooking.as well as for pickling. Mediterranean Cucumber - [ Cucumis sativus ]A mostly seedless cucumber normally sold unwaxed, so you can eat them skin-on. It's much shorter and straighter than the European Cucumber but has a much better flavor because the seed mass is proportionally larger - despite having no seeds to speak of. They're generally about 6 inches long, 1-1/4 inches in diameter and weighed about 3 oz. Some of the hassles of growing European cucumbers apply as well to the Mediterranean - they need special handling of the vine and are generally grown in hothouses even in California. They're too small to be efficiently shrink wrapped so they're probably not available in many areas. Here in Southern California, produce markets have big heaps of them, often priced as low as 2012 US $0.69 or $0.79 per pound and they sell very well. Peking Cucumber - See Beijing Cucumber . Persian Cucumber - [ Cucumis sativus ]A mostly seedless cucumber normally sold unwaxed, so you can eat them skin-on. In Southern California produce markets Persians alternate with Mediterranean cucumbers, though I'm not sure they don't just change the sign now and then, or perhaps different growers use alternate names - they look and taste pretty much the same. The last batch I bought labeled ""Persian"" averaged 5-1/4 inches long, 1-1/8 inches in diameter and weighed about 2 oz. The hassles of growing Mediterranean cucumbers apply as well to the Persian - they need special handling of the vine and are most often grown in hothouses even in California. They're too small to be efficiently shrink wrapped so they're probably not available in all areas. Pickle - [ Cucumis sativus ] While many vegetables are pickled, the cucumber so dominates the form it's the one you can call just ""pickle"" without a modifier. The cucumbers used are Kirby type or similar in the U. S. but other varieties may be used elsewhere. ""Quick pickles"" are made with cucumbers, a vinegar brine and spices. Natural pickles are made by packing cucumbers with water and salt to naturally ferment and make their own sourness. They are then cleaned up and processed with spices and other ingredients depending on what style pickle you're making. Wild Cucumber - California - [Cucamonga Manroot, Marah macrocarpus: California Manroot, Marah fabaceus: other Marah species | also Echinocystis lobata ]These perennial cucumbers are quite different from Cucumis cucumbers in the way the fruit functions. Rather than fleshy, the fruit is spiny and dry. When ripe it dries completely and splits at the end to spill the large seeds out. The fruit is not eaten and some say the unripe seeds may be ""mind altering"" but I haven't tried to find out. California Manroot is found over most of the state while Cucamonga Manroot is found over most or Southern California down to Baja. All parts of the plant are bitter but the leaves have reportedly been used as a vegetable. The root tubers can weigh well over 200 pounds and were crushed by Native Americans for a toxin to stun fish with, so you probably don't want to try eating those. A soap-like substance has been extracted from the roots. I have lots of these on my property in La Crescenta, CA, but growth and fruiting are very dependent on early spring rainfall. The photo, showing foliage, an unripe fruit, a just opened fruit with seeds, and a drying empty pod was taken during 2008, a very good year for these. This year, 2014, there was very little foliage and no fruit. Wild Cucumber - Other ""Wild Cucumber"" is a name used commercially for the Armenian Cucumber, which is actually a melon. There is also an African Wild Cucumber ( Cucumis africanus) which looks a lot like the California item but they're not closely related and the African one is edible. Fruit and leaves are eaten in Africa but only fruit in Madagascar. Health & Nutrition Cucumbers are largely water and eaten at an early stage where their seeds are immature and haven't developed much protein. They aren't nutrition powerhouses but they do have a broad range of vitamins and minerals in significant amounts and they are very low in calories and fat. Way back in the early '70s I used to get a nutritional publication from one of Ralph Nader's organizations. Ralph was saying pickles should be taken off the market because of their cost / nutritional content ratio was so low. The vitamin C content is degraded by pickling but some other nutrients may become more available - but I really don't think people are eating pickles for their nutritional value, Ralph. They eat them for taste. Links C1 - Cucurbit Botanical Info. - Cucurbit.org "

Our puppy is having his vaccinations at 8 and 10 weeks, how long after this will he be able to go out? Update: I'm not sure where everyone else is located, but I understood that this was the normal schedule of vaccinations? I've spoken to quite a lot of vets and they all seem to advise the same thing? Follow 14 answers Answers Relevance Rating Newest Oldest Best Answer: 8weeks and 10 weeks is right in UK people who say different are probably from the states so there vaccinations are different from ares. After his second vaccinaton you need to wait a week. I would also advice get him done for kennel cough which are drops up their nose.poodle power · 9 years ago0 0 Comment Asker's rating Should be fine after 2 weeks, though your vet will tell you the exact time. If you're able to, take him to a puppy class for socialising, your vets can advice you on where, they may even do it themselves. If you can carry lift your pup take him out to get used to smells/cars/everything really, trip in the car, just don't let him mix with dogs you don't know or in areas that strange dogs go. Try and find healthy dogs that you know have been vaccinated to socialise with in the garden. Ukredrosie · 9 years ago0 0 Comment I live in the UK, my vet did my Lab pup's jabs at 8 and 12 weeks. He then said wait another 7 days before you go out on walks. Our local pet shop owner, who has a Golden Retriever, said her vet made her wait 14 days after the second injection.sonofvi · 9 years ago1 0 Comment My dog has just finished his vaccinations and the vet told me a week before I was allowed to take him out of his own garden. He has been out and met my families dogs and he is doing very well.kittiebann · 9 years ago0 0 Commentyour puppy will also need vaccines at 12 and 15 weeks. wait at least 2 weeks after the last set before allowing puppy to have contact with other dogs. the moms immunity wears off around 12 weeks, so any vaccines given before then will not provide your pup with immunity (assuming mom had immunity to pass on), that is the reason for the 2 rounds after the 12 week mark.bob © · 9 years ago0 2 Comment That is too close together. They should be given no closer than three weeks to each other nor longer than 4 weeks apart. 8, 12 & 16 weeks is a good schedule as it makes the last shot at 16 weeks and then it will be the last one. The last shot in the puppy series needs to be given after the pups are 16 weeks or older. Then wait a month for the rabies shot. If there has been no disease in your yard like Parvo or distemper, your pup can go in your yard but do not take it out in public for 1 week after the second shot at the soonest. I usually wait until 1 week after the third shot. Source (s): UC Davis vet school recommendations Pat A · 9 years ago2 4 Comment Dog training techniques are controversial. But, which dog training techniques can you trust? Learn here http://Online Dog Training.enle.info/? EYb U The discussion about which dog training technique to use when training a dog is one that resembles a discussion between an Israeli and a Palestinian. Each one seems absolutely certain of their position and is more than ready to vilify those who don't share their views on dog training. But, if you look at dog training techniques and methods and evaluate their worth and effectiveness based on whether the approach is balanced, it's a lot easier to weed out the garbage. For the most part, trainers and their methods fall into two main categories. Those who do not use a physical consequence as a deterrent and those who do. There are many variations in the methods used by different trainers however, almost all trainers fall into one category or the other. Some trainers use food as a reward and never allow the dog to experience a negative consequence for a poor choice. Other trainers afford the dog the opportunity to experience a consequence for making poor choices. The Use Of Food: Using food is great in the sense that you will probably have a very happy dog on your hands when he realizes that the training comes with an all-you-can-eat buffet. However, using food to train your dog has some pitfalls we think you should be aware of. Food is great if you just want to impress your guests with a couple silly pet tricks but, in the real world, your dog will probably be much more interested in chasing the cat than hanging around to get your silly, dry biscuit. So, if you are using food as the primary or sole motivator, you're in for some disappointment when it comes time for your dog to perform in the real world. Strictly Positive Reinforcement: It is not difficult to find trainers who will tell you they use a kinder, gentler method than those used by consequence and reward trainers. They will tell you that your dog will be emotionally destroyed by the use of correction as a deterrent. Their goal is to sell you on their loving approach to dog training. They would have you believe that their method is much better than those old, barbaric correction methods. If you try to train your dog with a method of training that is as imbalanced as this, you will be in for some serious disappointments. Sure, it sounds like a great idea; training your dog and never having to correct him for making a poor choice. Never having to do the very thing you like doing the least. However, no matter how distasteful the concept of physical consequence is to you, it is necessary if you want a really good dog. You cannot consistently praise a dog when he does something right and never give him a consequence for doing something wrong, and expect him to turn out balanced. Consequence And Reward: In some cases, dog training methods that involve physical consequence as a deterrent cause additional problems. Not by virtue of the fact that the dog received a physical consequence for his poor choice, but because the training was too harsh, improper, or the balance between consequence and reward was not achieved. A bad trainer can destroy any good training system. It is far from true that methods using consequence as a deterrent will result in a fearful dog. It all depends on the skill of the trainer, the manner in which the dog is corrected and the balance between consequence and reward. Dog training techniques and methods that use a healthy balance between consequence and reward are without doubt, the most effective, healthy training techniques you can use. It is important to remember that consequence in NEVER connected to emotion while reward is always given with sincerity and love.? · 1 year ago0 0 Commenta pair of week, yet your vet could be attentive to there's a bad trojan horse around on your section. hear to his suggestion. it incredibly is in basic terms a pair of weeks interior the whole existence of your new puppy after all. and in certainty, maximum domestic canines should not be dragged around everywhere in the start line with. they might desire to be progressively geared up up (muscle groups, joints) so in fact, your vet could be doing you a favour via recommending you are not getting your puppy out in simple terms yet.conte · 2 years ago0 0 Comment12 weeks would be fine.

D1660718	http://www.avclub.com/article/here-i-am-on-the-road-again-16-convincingly-dire-s-65951	âHere I am, on the road againâ: 16 convincingly dire songs about touring	1. Bob Seger, “Turn The Page” Like most people, musicians occasionally let off steam by complaining about their jobs. Much of the time, these gripes are hard for listeners to relate to—who wouldn’t want to travel the country and enjoy the spoils of adoring fans, free booze, easy sexual conquests, and lots of money for doing something that seems really fun? Because touring is sometimes like Bob Seger’s “Turn The Page,” a song that reveals certain realities about life on the road that have nothing to do with the good-time fantasies that the rest of us buy into. “Turn The Page” lays out the themes explored by other convincingly dire songs about touring—the endless miles between gigs, the monotony of shows, the loneliness felt by performers even (or perhaps especially) when they’re in front of audiences, and the sense that touring is a punishing treadmill that’s impossible to climb down from. In “Turn The Page,” touring isn’t some crazy adventure; it’s payment for a Faustian deal for riches and stardom that costs the performer his home and humanity.2. Creedence Clearwater Revival, “Lodi” By the time Creedence Clearwater Revival released “Lodi,” it was well on its way to becoming one of the best and most popular rock bands of its generation. But John Fogerty still wasn’t far removed from his days as a club musician, when he would have “to play while people sat there drunk.” While “Lodi” isn’t based on actual events—Fogerty had never even been to Lodi when he wrote it, much less gotten stranded there—the song speaks to the experiences of bands that travel long distances to play gigs in small towns for a smattering of (mostly intoxicated) patrons. For Fogerty, those awful nights can be chalked up to dues-paying, but for most musicians it’s as good as it is ever going to get.3. Jawbreaker, “Tour Song” For the thousands of small-time bands who make the rounds in a cramped van, touring is tedious and occasionally soul-crushing. Jawbreaker’s litany of calamities in “Tour Song” explains why: There are sparsely attended and unpromoted gigs, hostile crowds, free shows, broken gear—“Every little thing, every little thing, every little, little thing, every little thing, every little thing must go wrong ,” howls guitarist-vocalist Blake Schwarzenbach. The song opens with him leaving a message on someone’s answering machine: “It’s Sunday, we’re broken down in the top of Massachusetts looking for a hotel room, show’s off. [Laughs.] It’s pretty heavy.”4. Silkworm, “Miracle Mile” Few songs about touring are as specific as Silkworm’s “Miracle Mile.” The band plays for 15 people and $30, there’s a sound guy who is strung out on Ex-Lax, and the sleeping bags get stolen by an addict with shitty pants. But Silkworm reserves most of its spite for the mechanics who jeopardize the band’s van, which on tour functions as a lifeline; it’s both a home and a way home. They “got ripped off by these assholes at a Fort Lee garage” who “didn’t weld that motherfucking leaf spring.” Only a band well-versed in van troubles on the road would know how to reference a leaf spring.5. Motörhead, “ (We Are) The Road Crew” Before chugging away cosmically in Hawkwind, Lemmy Kilmister briefly worked as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix. When he later formed Motörhead and growled “ (We Are) The Road Crew,” he was speaking from experience. The song details the relentless grind of touring that the stage-scoured Lemmy had found himself trapped in: “Eating junk, feeling bad / Another night, I’m going mad,” he gripes, before adding, “My woman’s leaving, I’m so sad.” Granted, he’s about as eloquent as Tarzan, but Lemmy admits that it’s no one’s fault but his that “another beer is what I need / Another gig, my ears bleed.”6. Lynyrd Skynyrd, “All I Can Do Is Write About It” Before dying along with two other members of Lynyrd Skynyrd in a plane crash in 1977, frontman Ronnie Van Zant already seemed to be tired of his rock-star life. Granted, Skynyrd had its fair share of songs about the joys of being rich and famous. But they were always tempered by introspective, even morose songs like “Am I Losing?” and “Simple Man,” where Van Zant pondered the increasing difficulty of life in the stage lights. His growing depression in the face of touring is most sweetly, sadly summed up in the acoustic “All I Can Do Is Write About It.” “Well this life that I live, it’s took me everywhere / There ain’t no place I ain’t never gone,” sings an exhausted Van Zant, “But it’s kind of like the saying you’ve heard so many times / Well there just ain’t no place like home.” The fact that touring literally killed Van Zant mere months after recording “All I Can Do Is Write About It” makes the song’s homesickness that much more devastating.7. Jerry Jeff Walker, “Life On The Road” Given that so much of country music involves mournful ruminating about one thing or another—usually about relationships, but in a pinch, practically anything will do—it’s no wonder that there are so many songs about the hard life musicians have to bear. For instance, Jerry Jeff Walker’s 1996 rolling lament “Life On The Road,” which grumbles about the necessity of seeing the world by bus “just so y’all can look at us.” His specific grievances are pretty mild, though: While he complains that touring “ain’t all it’s cracked up to be,” he doesn’t get too pointed, apart from the way the bus rocks and rolls, and the way he never knows where he is unless the driver tells him, and the necessity of packing all-black clothes because they’ll get washed “upon your back.” Mostly, though, the song is a basic description of touring that reads as though Walker wrote it on that bus while glancing around himself for inspiration: “You get a bed and a TV set / You get an ashtray for your cigarette / You get HBO, well, that’s life on the road.” (Just don’t confuse it with The Kinks’ unrelated 1977 song “Life On The Road,” which is more about general wanderlust and life dissatisfaction, and features a lot more gay sex than Walker’s version.)8. Loudon Wainwright III, “Motel Blues” If there’s one thing that’s great about touring, it’s the groupies, right? Not so, says Loudon Wainwright III, whose “Motel Blues” chronicles a one-night stand that’s downright depressing. In the song, “a lonely rock ’n’ roller” goes looking for companionship once the TV stations stop broadcasting at 2 a.m. He’s doing it out of boredom; sex is the only alternative to staring “at them ugly grass mat walls.” He finds a young girl who he begs to “save my life,” which sounds like a corny line but it works just the same. The next morning, he advises the girl to ignore the judging glances of the workers at the motel’s front desk; he promises to buy her breakfast, “they’ll think you’re my wife.”9. Iron Maiden, “Wasted Years” The 2009 documentary Iron Maiden: Flight 666 shows the veteran metal band shaking up the tedium of touring by letting frontman Bruce Dickinson—a licensed pilot—fly the group’s tour jet. Long before that, though, Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith wrote the epic song “Wasted Years,” in which Dickinson sings about the travails of traveling the globe in perpetual pursuit of metal godhood. “I close my eyes and think of home / Another city goes by in the night,” he wails like a Viking stuck in the dull cycle of raping and pillaging. “Ain’t it funny how it is, you never miss it ’til it’s gone away? / And my heart is lying there, and it will be ’til my dying day.” For a group whose reign of unabashed triumph hasn’t abated in 30 years, it’s a candid and personal moment of doubt. [pagebreak]10. ABBA, “Super Trouper” There’s much more angst to ABBA than many casual listeners realize, and “Super Trouper” is a perfect example. The group had always preferred the studio—where its pop symphonies could be perfectly orchestrated and executed—over the stage, and the title of “Super Trouper” refers to the blinding lights used in the increasingly huge stadiums ABBA found itself playing in. Anni-Frid Lyngstad sings of the odd, almost surreal detachment that comes from living such a life: “I was sick and tired of everything / When I called you last night from Glasgow / All I do is eat and sleep and sing / Wishing every show was the last show.” Eventually she puts her happy face back on and claims the lights shine “like the sun,” but lines like “How can anyone be so lonely / Part of a success that never ends?” sounds more hellish than happy. The romantic tensions within ABBA at the time are no secret now, but it’s interesting—and heartbreaking—to hear how isolated the individuals in this band of two married couples were during the height of their mega-success in the ’70s.11. Blur, “Look Inside America” In 1993’s “Miss America” and 1994’s “Magic America,” Blur seemed to have a pattern going. But its passing obsession with the United States culminated on the band’s self-titled album in 1997, which ditched Blur’s signature Britpop in favor of a grunge-and-indie-rock-influenced sound that seemed to celebrate and spoof America at the same time. “Look Inside America” was that album’s USA-centric tune—and in typical Blur fashion, it wields a sardonic blade that cuts both ways. “Got to play a second-rate chat show / A nationwide deal, so we gotta go,” deadpans frontman Damon Albarn as he catalogs the many depressing, soul-sucking ways the music industry has forced the group to whore itself out while on tour. “And the whole world could have passed through me / But I don’t know that it means much to me.” No wonder Albarn’s next project, Gorillaz, let him hide behind the virtual persona Stuart “2D” Pot.12. The Who, “Postcard” What seems at first like a jaunty travelogue detailing the Who’s exploits on the road is instead a plea for help from a never-ending nightmare in “Postcard.” There are “people who hurt us” in Germany, “bad vibes like confetti” in Italy, and a litany of other complaints from other parts of the world. The song itself is a letter back to a home that may or may not even exist for songwriter John Entwistle and the rest of the band. The final line (“We’ve done very well, but we’ve been to hell and heaven as well”) not only features a call-out to one of Entwistle’s most famous songs, but serves to underline the difference between fame and happiness. The Who might have been recognized around the world, but “the money’s all gone,” prompting the band to once again undertake the Sisyphean task of touring.13. Neil Young, “Tonight’s The Night” Neil Young was a twitchy, shy sort, and totally unsuited for rock stardom. It seemed inevitable that he’d eventually record an entire album inspired by the wages of his reluctant rock-star status, and he finally did it with 1975’s Tonight’s The Night. Less predictable were the circumstances that directly inspired the record, the deaths of Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten and Young’s friend and longtime roadie Bruce Berry, both of drug overdoses. “Tonight’s The Night,” which bookends the record, serves as a eulogy to Berry, a diligent “working man” who used to idle away the nights strumming away on Young’s guitar when he thought nobody was watching. The second verse tells of Young’s grief at hearing that Berry had died “out on the mainline.” “Tonight’s The Night” isn’t an anthem to road-weariness, but a creepy exaltation to the road-weary, to those who plug away night after night until they’re swallowed whole.14. Drive-By Truckers, “The Opening Act” The story of a fat man falling off a mechanical bull is much more prominent in this melancholy country-rock tune than tour-van horrors, but that’s the point: The song describes the humiliation of being onstage in front of a crowd that was ignoring the band even before the paramedics showed up. “There’s a band onstage that used to be huge / They’re on but no one’s listening / And they’re asked to turn down and they politely oblige.” And they’re the headliners. The lap steel sounds even more mournful about this state of affairs than it would for simple romantic troubles—at least the band onstage got some time in the sun before being banished to mechanical-bull purgatory. The singer’s just the opening act.15. The Bottle Rockets, “Indianapolis” Although the song predates Brian Henneman forming The Bottle Rockets—a demo version from 1991 features an assist from his pals in Uncle Tupelo, Jeff Tweedy and Jay Farrar —“Indianapolis” is most associated with Henneman’s band and is something of an anthem for life on the road. Ten days into a tour, a “fuel pump that’s deceased” strands Henneman and his bandmates in hell/Indianapolis—he really can’t tell the difference. Sitting in a bar four hours from his hometown, Henneman feels his loyalty wilting—“If I could catch a ride, I really think I’d ditch this band”—and his anxiety about the repair cost growing. Twisting the knife is the music at the bar: “I’ll puke if that jukebox plays John Cougar one more time.”16. The Rolling Stones, “Torn And Frayed” If touring really is such a bad life, why are so many musicians resigned to living it anyway? A clue is found in the Rolling Stones’ “Torn And Frayed,” a country-tinged rocker from Exile On Main St. Mick Jagger sings about the various aspects of touring life that drags musicians down—substance abuse, rootlessness, “dressing rooms filled with parasites”—and how this wear and tear eventually becomes visible to the audience. But none of it seems to matter “as long as the guitar plays,” a nod to the power of music “to steal your heart away” no matter the circumstances. Life on the road might be a bitch, but the music always seems to make it worth tolerating.

D2046552	http://cancergrace.org/radiation/2010/12/09/what-is-tomotherapy/	What is Tomotherapy?	What is Tomotherapy? Published December 9, 2010 | By Dr Mehta | 1 Comment Download PDF of this page Tomotherapy is a relatively new platform for the delivery of radiation therapy. The radiation is produced and delivered by a linear accelerator. This linear accelerator has been integrated into a CT scanner, a configuration that produces several potential advantages. First, the patient can undergo a CT scan just prior to the delivery of radiotherapy. The CT scan obtained prior to the delivery of radiation is used to ensure that the internal targets or tissues that one is seeking to avoid have not changed their location between treatments. This is also called IGRT, or Image-Guided Radiotherapy. IGRT very cleary improves the accuracy and precision of the radiotherapy that is delivered. The potential benefits of this improvement are that less normal and healthy tissue will be exposed to radiation. While this is intuitively a very good thing, it has not been conclusively demonstrated (yet) to be of clinical benefit to each and every patient. Another advantage is that multiple remote areas can be targeted simultaneously. For some patients, this approach might be particularly useful. Finally, the treatment is delivered from a large number of angles (or helical arcs from a simplistic viewpoint), which allows for more honed deliver of radiation. Some of the unique advantages of this platform have been challenged recently. A technique called VMAT, or Volumetric Arc Therapy (produced by Elekta) and Rapid Arc (produced by Varian) are rival approaches. The radiation is also delivered in one or more “Arcs” of treatment. The linear accelerator comes equipped with IGRT equipment that allows for obtaining a near CT -quality image just prior to treatment. There have been a number of comparison studies between these newer approaches and Tomotherapy. While there might be some very unique cases that are better situated to Tomotherapy, most cases of lung cancer can be treated equally well on both platforms. We have published a comparison study as well, which suggests much the same thing. While the software and hardware for Tomotherapy have improved considerably in the last few years, the delivery time using either VMAT or Rapid Arc is considerably shorter than Tomotherapy. This shorter delivery time has theorectical and practical (you are off the treatment table faster) advantages. I consider myself very lucky to practice in an institution that tries to offer all technologies. We were among the first in the country with IGRT, VMAT, Cyberknife, Gamma Knife, and most recently, Tomotherapy. I strongly believe that patients are best treated by physicians that are experienced in all platforms and can offer patients the best possible treatment plan regardless of platform. Unfortunately, the optimum solution and treatment for a given patient is going to be unique for them.

For the F-4D Phantom, see Mc Donnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. F4D (F-6) Skyray Role Fighter aircraft Manufacturer Douglas Aircraft Company Designer Ed Heinemann First flight 23 January 1951Introduction 1956Retired 1964Status Phased out of service Primary users United States Navy United States Marine Corps Produced 1950–1958Number built 422Developed into Douglas F5D Skylancer The Douglas F4D Skyray (later redesignated F-6 Skyray) was an American carrier-based fighter / interceptor built by the Douglas Aircraft Company. Although it was in service for a relatively short time and never entered combat, it was the first carrier -launched aircraft to hold the world's absolute speed record, at 752.943 mph, [1] and was the first United States Navy and United States Marine Corps fighter that could exceed Mach 1 in level flight. It was the last fighter produced by the Douglas Aircraft Company before it merged with Mc Donnell Aircraft and became Mc Donnell Douglas. The F5D Skylancer was an advanced development of the F4D Skyray that did not go into service. Contents [ hide ]1 Design and development2 Operational history2.1 F5D Skylancer3 Variants4 Operators5 Aircraft on display6 Specifications (F4D-1)7 See also8 Notes9 References10 External links Design and development [ edit]The XF4D-1 prototype aboard Coral Sea, in October 1953. The Skyray was designed to meet a Navy requirement issued in 1947 for a fighter aircraft that could intercept and destroy an enemy aircraft at an altitude of 50,000 ft (15,240 m) within five minutes of the alarm being sounded. [2] The Navy also wanted an aircraft that followed the designs and research of the German aerodynamicist Alexander Lippisch, who moved to the U. S. after World War II. The F4D Skyray was a wide delta wing design with long, sharply swept, rounded wings. The design was named for its resemblance to the manta ray. [3] The thick wing roots contained the air intakes feeding a single turbojet engine. Fuel was contained both in the wings and the deep fuselage. Leading edge slats were fitted for increased lift during takeoff and landing, while the trailing edges were mostly elevon control surfaces. Additional pitch trimmers were fitted inboard near the jet exhaust, and were locked upwards on takeoff and landing. The Westinghouse J40 turbojet was the intended powerplant, but Douglas took a conservative view and designed in contingency options for other power plants. The J40 proved troublesome and was eventually cancelled, and the Skyray was fitted instead with the Pratt & Whitney J57, a more powerful but larger engine. Production aircraft were not delivered until early 1956, while the United States Marine Corps received their first in 1957. In total, 419 F4D-1 (later designated F-6 in the unified designation system) aircraft were produced. Its unique design also played a part in making the Skyray one of the best-known early jet fighters. It was affectionately known as the ""Ford"" (after the ""Four"" and ""D"" of its designation). [4] In 1953, Edward H. Heinemann was awarded the Collier Trophy in recognition of his design work on the F4D. [5]Operational history [ edit]APQ-50A radar of an F4D-1A F4D-1 of VF (AW)-3 in flight over San Diego. In April 1956, VC-3 was the first squadron operational with the F4D-1. [1] This unit was later redesignated VFAW-3 and assigned to NORAD, as the only United States Navy fighter squadron in what was predominantly a United States Air Force and Royal Canadian Air Force organization. VFAW-3 was permanently based at NAS North Island in San Diego. The U. S. Marine Corps also flew the Skyray. When the Department of Defense adopted a uniform aircraft designation system patterned on the U. S. Air Force aircraft designation system in September 1962, the F4D was redesignated as the F-6A Skyray. In addition to multiple Navy and Marine Corps squadrons, Naval Air Reserve and Marine Air Reserve squadrons VF-881, VF-882 and VMF-215 also flew the Skyray. The last operational squadron was VMF (AW)-115, which flew the Skyray until February 1964. The Skyray was designed exclusively for the high-altitude interception role, with a high rate and angle of climb. It set a new time-to-altitude record, flying from a standing start to 49,221 feet (15,003 m) in 2 minutes and 36 seconds, all while flying at a 70° pitch angle. [1] As a dedicated interceptor, the F4D was unsuited to the multi-mission capabilities soon in demand, so it had a short career in Navy and Marine Corps service, the last aircraft being withdrawn from service in 1964. Four aircraft were used by NACA (soon to be NASA) until 1969. [6]Under the new 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system, the F4D-1 was redesignated the F-6A. The F4D (old designation) should not be confused with the F-4D (new designation) – the latter being the ""D"" variant of the Mc Donnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II operated by the U. S. Air Force. F5D Skylancer [ edit]Main article: F5D Skylancer The F5D Skylancer was derived from the F4D and intended to be a Mach 2 capable successor to the Skyray. Although four prototypes were built and flown, the project was cancelled as being too similar in mission parameters to the F8U Crusader and also to reduce dependence upon Douglas Aircraft, which was also producing several other aircraft for the U. S. Navy. [6]Variants [ edit]F4D-1 Skyray XF4D-1Prototypes, redesignated YF-6A in 1962, two built F4D-1Single-seat fighter aircraft, production model redesignated F-6A in 1962, 420 built.

D2857237	http://homeguides.sfgate.com/remove-stains-cutlery-91429.html	How to Remove Stains From Cutlery	Related Articles How to Remove Stains and Tarnish From Regular Kitchen Silverware How to Remove Stains From Utensils How to Paint Over Tar Stains Taking Corrosion off Pavers Cutlery is subject to exposure to all kinds of substances through regular use: greasy foods, minerals and detergents, to name a few. Over time, that once-sparkling flatware's finish becomes dull and stained. Even stainless-steel cutlery stains. In many cases, these stains can be rubbed away with items already in the kitchen; sometimes, it may take more than one method to completely remove a stain.1Pour a small amount of white vinegar onto a nonabrasive white cloth. Wipe down the cutlery with the cloth to remove general stains and marks such as white hard-water deposits. Rinse and dry with a fresh white cloth.2Fill the sink with 1 inch of hot water -- enough to completely cover a layer of cutlery. Pour in 1 tablespoon of baking soda, swishing it around to dissolve the powder. Add the cutlery to the baking-soda soak and allow them to sit for 10 or 15 minutes. Rinse the cutlery and buff each piece separately.3Add a squirt of mild dish soap to shallow bowl of hot water. Dip a sponge or dishcloth into the soapy water, then wipe cutlery tinted with a rainbow discoloration. This discoloration happens from a dishwasher that doesn't rinse and dry adequately if strong detergents are used to clean the cutlery, or if the cutlery has been exposed to extremely hot grease. Rinse and dry the cutlery after rubbing with the soapy water. This method also removes some chalky hard-water deposits left behind when cutlery is left to air dry.4Apply a dab of stainless-steel cutlery polish to a soft white cloth. Rub stainless cutlery to remove stains and restore shine. Rinse and dry as directed by the polish package instructions, which may vary by brand. Things You Will Need White vinegar Nonabrasive white cloth such as a tea towel Baking soda Mild dishwashing liquid Sponge or dishcloth Shallow bowl Stainless-steel cutlery polish Tips Rinse food debris off cutlery immediately after use to help prevent stains. Wipe sticky foods away with a wet dishcloth, as the substance becomes more difficult to remove once it hardens. Keep silverware and stainless-steel cutlery separated, as stainless may affect the color of the silver if they touch. Avoid using abrasives such as steel wool on cutlery as this may cause fine scratches, which harbor stains. Fine scratches also detract from the cutlery's finish. Do not leave cutlery immersed for extended times in substances that may stain, such as coffee, tea or even some soups.

(Handout / Courtesy of KTLA-TV Channel 5)Matt Hamilton Contact Reporter A 19-year-old man suspected of killing a 5-year-old boy in a hit-and-run crash in South Los Angeles surrendered Wednesday to police. Flanked by his family, Homer Watford arrived at the LAPD ’s 77th Street Station and told a desk officer that he drove the SUV that struck the young boy, identified as Ronald O’Neal. In an interview with detectives, Watford provided a statement and admitted to his role in the crash. He was booked on suspicion of felony hit-and-run and remains in Los Angeles County jail in lieu of $50,000 bond, according to jail records. The deadly incident occurred Tuesday about 5:15 p.m. near 82nd Street and Towne Avenue in Florence, according to LAPD Officer Sal Ramirez. Authorities said a dark green, faded Chevrolet Suburban from the mid-1990s was traveling westbound on 82nd Street toward Towne Avenue. The boy ran into the street and was struck by the vehicle. Ronald was pronounced dead at a hospital. The driver failed to stop and help the boy, authorities said. A surveillance camera captured an image of the SUV suspected of crashing into a 5-year-old boy and fleeing the scene. (KTLA-TV)The boy’s mother said he would have turned 6 in May.“Ronald was my baby,” Jaychele Turner told KTLA-TV Channel 5. “I’m just going to miss him playing the drums, playing a game, dancing.”Turner said her son may have been trying to help nab a neighbor’s dog. He did not usually run into the street, she said. Authorities said the SUV rounded a corner, then stopped after striking the boy. It drove off at a high speed. Police said the driver may have struck the boy a second time when fleeing. Watford’s 20-year-old cousin, Eric Roberts, was also in the car at the time of the crash, police said. Investigators interviewed Roberts and he provided a statement. As of late Wednesday, Roberts had not been arrested.

Is an annuity suitable for me? For some, annuities can complement a total retirement income strategy to supplement other sources of money during retirement. Annuities have advantages such as allowing you to pay in unlimited premiums and they grow compound tax-deferred. (Upon withdrawals,** you will pay taxes on interest earned and the principal if the annuity was purchased with pre-tax dollars.) However, annuities are not for everyone. What are the different types of annuities? There are different types of annuities to meet the specific needs of individual retirees and pre-retirees.

He finds a glimmer of hope in the mysterious, über-cool and beautiful Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and with the aim of winning her heart he invites her to star in his band's music videos. There's only one problem: he's not part of a band...yet.

D2076611	http://agathachristie.wikia.com/wiki/Murder_at_the_Gallop	Murder at the Gallop	"Theatrical release poster by Tom Jung Murder at the Gallop is the second of four ""Miss Marple"" films made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It was based on the novel After the Funeral by Agatha Christie, and starred Margaret Rutherford as Miss Jane Marple, Charles ""Bud"" Tingwell as Inspector Craddock and Stringer Davis (Rutherford's real-life husband) as Jane Marple's friend Mr. Stringer. The film changes both the action and the characters. The original novel featured Hercule Poirot rather than Miss Marple, and Christie's trademark suspense was replaced by light comedy. The film was made in 1963 and was directed by George Pollock, with James P. Cavanagh credited with the adaptation. The music was by Ron Goodwin. Hilfield Castle featured in the film. Plot Edit While Miss Marple and Mr Stringer are soliciting donations for a charity, they visit Mr Enderby, a rich and eccentric recluse. He tumbles down a staircase, apparently the victim of a fatal heart attack. Knowing that Enderby had a pathological fear of cats, Miss Marple becomes suspicious when she finds one in the house. She also finds a piece of mud bearing the print of a riding boot, but when she goes to Inspector Craddock, he is sceptical, believing that Enderby died of natural causes. Undeterred, Miss Marple eavesdrops when Enderby's family gather for the reading of the Will. Each of the four heirs (fourth cousin George Crossfield, niece Rosamund Shane, nephew Hector Enderby and sister Cora Lanskenay) receives an equal share of the estate. Cora declares that she believes Enderby was murdered. The next day, when Miss Marple goes to see her, she finds Cora dead, stabbed in the back with a hatpin. Cora's companion of many years, timid Miss Milchrest (Flora Robson), can provide little information. Miss Marple decides to take a ""holiday"" at the Gallop Hotel/riding school, as it is run by Hector Enderby (Robert Morley) and the other two surviving heirs are staying there. Inspector Craddock questions them (and Rosamund Shane's spendthrift husband Michael), but none of them can produce a satisfactory alibi for the time of Cora Lanskenay's death. An attempt is made to do away with Miss Marple, but is foiled by the intended victim (without her even realising it). Miss Marple then discovers that the piece of mud found in Enderby's house came from shady art dealer George Crossfield's riding boot, but her case against him is dashed when she learns that each of the heirs visited Enderby on the day he died. Crossfield has meanwhile found out who the murderer is, but he is locked in a stall with an excitable horse and is trampled to death. By this point, Miss Marple knows the identity and motive of the killer, but has no definite proof. She therefore lays a trap, pretending to have a heart attack at a dance at the hotel while doing the twist with Stringer. The police doctor places her in a room by herself, declaring it to be too dangerous to move her until morning. During the night, the criminal makes one last attempt to silence her, but Miss Marple is ready. The killer is revealed to be Miss Milchrest, disguised as Cora. She had been after Cora's seemingly worthless painting.

D954913	https://seroter.wordpress.com/2014/01/09/data-stream-processing-with-amazon-kinesis-and-net-applications/	Data Stream Processing with Amazon Kinesis and .NET Applications	"Data Stream Processing with Amazon Kinesis and . NET Applications By Richard Seroter on January 9, 2014 • ( 7 )Amazon Kinesis is a new data stream processing service from AWS that makes it possible to ingest and read high volumes of data in real-time. That description may sound vaguely familiar to those who followed Microsoft’s attempts to put their CEP engine Stream Insight into the Windows Azure cloud as part of “Project Austin.” Two major differences between the two: Kinesis doesn’t have the stream query aspects of Stream Insight, and Amazon actually SHIPPED their product. Kinesis looks pretty cool, and I wanted to try out a scenario where I have (1) a Windows Azure Web Site that generates data, (2) Amazon Kinesis processing data, and (3) an application in the Century Link Cloud which is reading the data stream. What is Amazon Kinesis? Kinesis provides a managed service that handles the intake, storage, and transportation of real-time streams of data. Each stream can handle nearly unlimited data volumes. Users set up shards which are the means for scaling up (and down) the capacity of the stream. All the data that comes into the a Kinesis stream is replicated across AWS availability zones within a region. This provides a great high availability story. Additionally, multiple sources can write to a stream, and a stream can be read by multiple applications. Data is available in the stream for up to 24 hours, meaning that applications (readers) can pull shard records based on multiple schemes: given sequence number, oldest record, latest record. Kinesis uses Dynamo DB to store application state (like checkpoints). You can interact with Kinesis via the provided REST API or via platform SDKs. What DOESN’T Kinesis do? It doesn’t have any sort of adapter model, so it’s up to the developer to build producers (writers) and applications (readers). There is a nice client library for Java that has a lot of built in logic for application load balancing and such. But for the most part, this is still a developer-oriented solution for building big data processing solutions. Setting up Amazon Kinesis First off, I logged into the AWS console and located Kinesis in the navigation menu. I’m then given the choice to create a new stream. Next, I need to choose the initial number of shards for the stream. I can either put in the number myself, or use a calculator that helps me estimate how many shards I’ll need based on my data volume. After a few seconds, my managed Kinesis stream is ready to use. For a given stream, I can see available shards, and some Cloud Watch metrics related to capacity, latency, and requests. I now have an environment for use!Creating a data producer Now I was ready to build an ASP. NET web site that publishes data to the Kinesis endpoint. The AWS SDK for . NET already Kinesis objects, so no reason to make this more complicated than it has to be. My ASP. NET site has Nu Get packages that reference JSON. NET (for JSON serialization), AWS SDK, j Query, and Bootstrap. The web application is fairly basic. It’s for ordering pizza from a global chain. Imagine sending order info to Kinesis and seeing real-time reactions to marketing campaigns, weather trends, and more. Kinesis isn’t a messaging engine per se, but it’s for collecting and analyzing data. Here, I’m collecting some simplistic data in a form. When clicking the “order” button, I build up the request and send it to a particular Kinesis stream. First, I added the following “using” statements:using Newtonsoft. Json; using Amazon. Kinesis; using Amazon. Kinesis. Model; using System. IO; using System. Text;The button click event has the following (documented) code. Notice a few things. My AWS credentials are stored in the web.config file, and I pass in an Amazon Kinesis Config to the client constructor. Why? I need to tell the client library which AWS region my Kinesis stream is in so that it can build the proper request URL. See that I added a few properties to the actual put request object. First, I set the stream name. Second, I added a partition key which is used to place the record in a given shard. It’s a way of putting “like” records in a particular shard.protected void btn Order_Click (object sender, Event Args e) { //generate unique order id string order Id = System. Guid. New Guid (). To String (); //build up the CLR order object Order o = new Order () { Id = order Id, Source = ""web"", Store Id = storeid. Text, Pizza Id = pizzaid. Text, Timestamp = Date Time. Now. To String () }; //convert to byte array in prep for adding to stream byte [] o Byte = Encoding. UTF8. Get Bytes (Json Convert. Serialize Object (o)); //create stream object to add to Kinesis request using (Memory Stream ms = new Memory Stream (o Byte)) { //create config that points to AWS region Amazon Kinesis Config config = new Amazon Kinesis Config (); config. Region Endpoint = Amazon. Region Endpoint. USEast1; //create client that pulls creds from web.config and takes in Kinesis config Amazon Kinesis Client client = new Amazon Kinesis Client (config); //create put request Put Record Request request Record = new Put Record Request (); //list name of Kinesis stream request Record. Stream Name = ""Order Stream""; //give partition key that is used to place record in particular shard request Record. Partition Key = ""weborder""; //add record as memorystream request Record. Data = ms; //PUT the record to Kinesis Put Record Response response Record = client. Put Record (request Record); //show shard ID and sequence number to user lbl Shard Id. Text = ""Shard ID: "" + response Record. Shard Id; lbl Sequence. Text = ""Sequence #:"" + response Record. Sequence Number; } }With the web application done, I published it to a Windows Azure Web Site. This is super easy to do with Visual Studio 2013, and within a few seconds my application was there. Finally, I submitted a bunch of records to Kinesis by adding pizza orders. Notice the shard ID and sequence number that Kinesis returns from each PUT request. Creating a Kinesis application (record consumer)To realistically read data from a Kinesis stream, there are three steps. First, you need to describe the stream in order to find out the shards. If I want a fleet of servers to run this application and read the stream, I’d need a way for each application to claim a shard to work on. The second step is to retrieve a “shard iterator” for a given shard. The iterator points to a place in the shard where I want to start reading data. Recall from above that I can start with the latest unread records, oldest records, or at a specific point in the shard. The third and final step is to get the records from a particular iterator. Part of the result set of this operation is a “next iterator” value. In my code, if I find another iterator value, I once again call the “get records” operation to pull any records from that iterator position. Here’s the total code block, documented for your benefit.private static void Read From Kinesis () { //create config that points to Kinesis region Amazon Kinesis Config config = new Amazon Kinesis Config (); config. Region Endpoint = Amazon. Region Endpoint. USEast1; //create new client object Amazon Kinesis Client client = new Amazon Kinesis Client (config); //Step #1 - describe stream to find out the shards it contains Describe Stream Request describe Request = new Describe Stream Request (); describe Request. Stream Name = ""Order Stream""; Describe Stream Response describe Response = client. Describe Stream (describe Request); List<Shard> shards = describe Response. Stream Description. Shards; foreach (Shard s in shards) { Console. Write Line (""shard: "" + s. Shard Id); } //grab the only shard ID in this stream string primary Shard Id = shards [0]. Shard Id; //Step #2 - get iterator for this shard Get Shard Iterator Request iterator Request = new Get Shard Iterator Request (); iterator Request. Stream Name = ""Order Stream""; iterator Request. Shard Id = primary Shard Id; iterator Request. Shard Iterator Type = Shard Iterator Type. TRIM_HORIZON; Get Shard Iterator Response iterator Response = client. Get Shard Iterator (iterator Request); string iterator = iterator Response. Shard Iterator; Console. Write Line (""Iterator: "" + iterator); //Step #3 - get records in this iterator Get Shard Records (client, iterator); Console. Write Line (""All records read. ""); Console. Read Line (); } private static void Get Shard Records (Amazon Kinesis Client client, string iterator Id) { //create reqest Get Records Request get Request = new Get Records Request (); get Request. Limit = 100; get Request. Shard Iterator = iterator Id; //call ""get"" operation and get everything in this shard range Get Records Response get Response = client. Get Records (get Request); //get reference to next iterator for this shard string next Iterator = get Response. Next Shard Iterator; //retrieve records List<Record> records = get Response. Records; //print out each record's data value foreach (Record r in records) { //pull out (JSON) data in this record string s = Encoding. UTF8. Get String (r. Data. To Array ()); Console. Write Line (""Record: "" + s); Console. Write Line (""Partition Key: "" + r. Partition Key); } if (null != next Iterator) { //if there's another iterator, call operation again Get Shard Records (client, next Iterator); } }Now I had a working Kinesis application that can run anywhere. Clearly it’s easy to run this on AWS EC2 servers (and the SDK does a nice job with retrieving temporary credentials for apps running within EC2), but there’s a good chance that cloud users have a diverse portfolio of providers. Let’s say I love the application services from AWS, but like the server performance and management capabilities from Century Link. In this case, I built a Windows Server to run my Kinesis application. With my server ready, I ran the application and saw my shards, my iterators, and my data records. Very cool and pretty simple. Don’t forget that each data consumer has some work to do to parse the stream, find the (partition) data they want, and perform queries on it. You can imagine loading this into an Observable and using LINQ queries on it to aggregate data. Regardless, it’s very nice to have a durable stream processing service that supports replays and multiple readers. Summary The “ internet of things ” is here, and companies that can quickly gather and analyze data will have a major advantage. Amazon Kinesis is an important service to that end, but don’t think of it as something that ONLY works with other applications in the AWS cloud. We saw here that you could have all sorts of data producers running on devices, on-premises, or in other clouds. The Kinesis applications that consume data can also run virtually anywhere. The modern architect recognizes that composite applications are the way to go, and hopefully this helped you understand another services that’s available to you!Advertisements Share this: Twitter Linked In Facebook Reddit Google Email Loading...‹ How Do I Get Things Done?

This definition is not dependent upon location (i.e., abuse can occur while the child is in an out-of-home or in-home setting. Shaken Baby Syndrome: infants, babies or small children who suffer injuries or death from severe shaking, jerking, pushing or puling may have been victims of Shaken Baby Syndrome. The act of shaking a baby is considered physical abuse, as spinal, head and neck injuries often result from violently shaking young children. Neglect: Failure by a caretaker, either deliberately or through negligence or inability to take those actions necessary to provide a child with minimally adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care, supervision, emotional stability and growth, or other essential care; provided, however, that such inability is not due solely to inadequate economic resources or solely to the existence of a handicapping condition. This definition is not dependent upon location (i.e., neglect can occur while the child is in an out-of-home setting). Emotional Injury: an impairment to or disorder of the intellectual or psychological capacity of a child as evidenced by observable and substantial reduction in the child's ability to function within a normal range of performance and behavior. Physical Injury: Death; or fracture of a bone, subdural hematoma, burns, impairment of any organ, and any other such nontrivial injury; or soft tissue swelling or skin bruising, depending upon such factors as the child's age, circumstances under which the injury occurred and the number and location of bruises; or addiction to a drug or drugs at birth; or failure to thrive. Institutional Abuse or Neglect: Abuse or neglect which occurs in any facility for children, including, but not limited to, group homes, residential or public or private schools, hospitals, detention and treatment facilities, family foster care homes, group day care centers and family day care homes.

Decompress the file .tgz with the following command:tar -xzvf Full Prof_Suite_XXXXNNNN_Lin.tgz Tell the users to activate the environment variable FULLPROF in their configuration file (see below)Local Mode (Installation for a single user)Create a directory in which you want to hold the programs of the Full Prof_Suite, e.g. $HOME/Full Prof_Suite For doing that you must execute the following commands:cd $HOME mkdir Full Prof_Suite cd Full Prof_Suite Copy the file Full Prof_Suite_XXXXNNNN_Lin.tgz (XXXX=Month NNNN=year) in the directory just created in step 2Decompress the file .tgz with the following command:tar -xzvf Full Prof_Suite_XXXXNNNN_Lin.tgz Modify the configuration file to activate the environment variable FULLPROF (see below)Activation of the environment variable of the Full Prof_Suite Depending of the SHELL of the user the commands are different. The aim is to create the environment variable FULLPROF. To know what is the shell one is using you should execute the command:echo $SHELLGenerally it is one of the following: Bourne (sh, bash), Korn (ksh), C (csh)From now we suppose we are using the Bourne of bash type. If you have another one you must consult how to do the equivalent commands we explain below. Edit the setting file of the user. In our case it should be in the root directory of the user and the name is .bashrc or .bash_profile Add the environment variable FULLPROF, that has as value the absolute path of the directory in which we have installed the programs of the Full Prof Suite. For instance: FULLPROF=/opt/Full Prof_Suite FULLPROF=/usr/local/bin/Full Prof_Suite<Add the above directory to the PATH variable PATH=$FULLPROF:$PATHExport the defined variableexport FULLPROFThe changes will be effective on opening a new terminal window. To verify that everything is OK, just type in your terminal the command:echo $FULLPROFThe system will show the directory in which you have installed the programs. After performing all the above steps all the programs of the Full Prof Suite are available from whatever working directory. If you need to update the Full Prof Suite you just have to do the steps 3 and 4 of the General or Local mode described above. Only in the case you decide to use another directory you have to redefine the environment variable. You can use the programs in console mode or use the toolbar (command tfp) to access the different programs. Depending of your installation you may need to install the libraries of Open Motif version 2.3. Do that only in case one of the GUIs doesn't work and you see a message of the form: ""lib Xm.so.3"" not available or something similar. "

D1351476	http://blackbag.gawker.com/did-beyonce-fake-her-pregnancy-1693597363	Did BeyoncÃ© Fake Her Pregnancy?	"Did Beyoncé Fake Her Pregnancy?473.52KGabrielle Bluestone03/26/15 03:05PM Filed to: illuminati month Beyoncé's 2011 pregnancy was more than just the buildup to the birth of Blue Ivy—it was also a gestation period for crazed baby-conspiracy theorists. Why did one of the world's foremost experts in self-promotion release only a few arty pictures of her stomach to document the pregnancy? How did she manage to give birth in a Manhattan hospital without any information about the event itself leaking from a third party? And what was with her stomach collapsing during that one TV appearance? All good mysteries, easily solved by the chaise-lounge conspiracy theorist: Duh. Beyoncé was never pregnant. The No, No, No Baby Theory essentially boils down to three pieces of evidence: 1) the shifting stomach 2) the shifting due date and 3) the dearth of pregnancy photos. Why would Beyoncé fake a pregnancy? Most theorists point to vanity or possible fertility problems. (She has previously spoken candidly about a prior pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage, and addressed the subject in songs. )Some say the image-conscious power-wife opted to raise Jay Z's illegitimate child (the product of an extramarital affair with an unknown woman) as her own, rather than get divorced. Others argue (outlandishly, given her appearance) that Blue Ivy is neither Beyoncé's daughter, nor Jay Z's, but rather the offspring of Beyoncé's philandering father, Matthew Knowles, secretly adopted by the Carters. No matter which school of thought you subscribe to, most conspiracy theorists agree the pregnancé conspiracé officially began on August 28, 2011 when Bey attended the VMA's dressed in a loose orange gown, cradling what appeared to be a pregnancy bump. She ended her performance that evening by unbuttoning her jacket and rubbing her visibly rounded stomach, as a camera cut to Jay Z receiving congratulations from a jubilant Kanye West. Image via AP""I put a lot of thought into how I wanted to unveil it. It was important to me that I was able to do it myself,"" Beyoncé told reporters at the time. An impeccably planned announcement, as befitting the notoriously detail-oriented performer. But almost immediately, Beyoncé began contradicting herself with statements about the pregnancy's progress. She claimed, in a September interview, that her due date was in February, which would make her four months pregnant at the VMAs. But at a video shoot for ""Countdown"" that same month, she said she was six months along, making her five months pregnant at the VMAs—the right timing for Blue Ivy's January 7 birthdate. So she was trying to fake out the press, the reasonable fan says. What else you got? A pregnant stomach, which Beyoncé seemed to have only occasionally. Despite sporting a substantial bump at the VMA's, there's no hint of it in the music video for Party, reportedly shot earlier that month. Your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. Click here to visit our frequently asked questions about HTML5 video.0:00 / 3:41That's easy to explain: Maybe they bound her up and Photoshopped her a little. But a week after the VMA's, she allowed herself to be photographed wearing a bikini in Croatia with Jay-Z. The bump she was sporting looked significantly smaller than it had at the awards show. I could do that, whispers the burrito-eating theorist. Even harder to explain were the physics on display at an interview with Australia's Sunday Night. In a bend seen round the world, Beyoncé's bump appeared to deflate as she sat down: Image via Mommyish.com At this point, the conspiracy began picking up celebrity followers. ""I dont think she was pregnant. The deflated stomach thing. I watched the video and I don't know. She sat down and she looked up like 'Oh shit',"" Tamar Braxton later said. After conducting a test with two of her pregnant staffers, Wendy Williams concurred: Now being a woman, I had my baby bump. Many of you have had baby bumps. I never remember [squatting]. Just take a look at the video. She's either giving birth to a frisbee, or Stewie from family guy. What is that, B? I was on bed rest the whole time, I'm not exactly sure. But I can tell you, when I would get out of the bed and sit up at a kitchen table, I wouldn't be able to sit like that. Like, I was so concerned about my back and the baby. Even at 5 months I sat like [stands up and leans back into the chair] this. Even mommy bloggers jumped into the fray. Said one: ""In my experience, pregnant women assume seats slowly and lean back as they ease into a chair to secure a good landing. Generally, they do not lean forward with their big bellies, straining their backs. """"It was fabric that folded—does fabric not fold? Oh my gosh, so stupid,"" explained Beyoncé. Well, you may be thinking, surely someone saw her give birth? She didn't pop the kid out at home. Maybe, but no one's talking!According to reports, Bey and Jay paid $1.3 million to secure and redecorate the entire fourth floor NICU wing of Manhattan's Lenox Hill Hospital. On the alleged day of Blue Ivy's birth, January 7, 2012: After 11 p.m., even doctors and nurses were barred from entering the fourth floor, prompting one doc to complain that he had patients to see. In an effort to keep images from leaking to the public, hospital workers placed tape over security cameras and are forcing employees to turn in cell phones when they arrive for their shifts, a source said. Several security guards were spotted patrolling the perimeter of the hospital Saturday night. A Lenox Hill staffer confirmed that a patient named Ingrid Jackson [Bey's apparent pseudonym] was in a ""labor room. """"I feel more beautiful than I've ever felt because I've given birth,"" Beyoncé later said of the experience. ""I have never felt so connected, never felt like I had such a purpose on this earth. ""So where are all the pictures of this pregnant woman? Wouldn't a woman planning on launching a maternity line photograph that bump as often as possible? Put short, Beyoncé's response to her changing body was... underwhelming. In fact, it took two years for her to release any private photos at all. During her 2013 HBO special, Life is But a Dream, Beyoncé finally shared a series of blurry pregnancy photos and delivered a short message about the ""rumors,"" which essentially denied nothing. And while stylistically intriguing, none of the belly shots—seemingly included to prove Beyoncé was really pregnant at the time—look particularly difficult to fake. ""There's a stupid rumor,"" Beyoncé says of the surrogacy claims in the film, looking down and shaking her head. It's actually the most ridiculous rumor I think I've ever had, about me. But there are actually a lot of people that believe this rumor and it's crazy. I guess there are some crazy celebrities in the world, so we get a bad rep, but...um...to think that I would be that vain. And I respect mothers and women so much and to be able to experience bringing a child into this world if you're lucky and fortunate enough to get the opportunity, people should have boundaries. There's certain things that you just shouldn't play around with, and a child, you don't play around with that. A fine message, but one that doesn't deny the most popular Blue Ivy conspiracy theory: that a surrogate carried the babé. Why not explicitly put the rumors to rest? Beyoncé's statement, in essence, denies only that she would hire a surrogate out of vanity. The message seems irrelevant if say, fertility issues drove the surrogacy. As Rich Juzwiak points out in his excellent analysis, the choice to avoid hard evidence was hardly unintentional: Regardless, it makes sense that given the time examined, Beyoncé's movie would chronicle Beyoncé's pregnancy and the controversy it birthed. The problem with Life Is But a Dream 's treatment of her pregnancy isn't that it protests too much – it protests too weirdly. We never see a full, clear shot of Beyoncé's pregnant, swanlike body. Instead it's presented in pieces, owing to the limitations of her Mac webcam. When her body is shown in full, it's in grainy, black and white footage in which her face is shadowed. Why, though? If you're going to present an image of your pregnant self to prove the naysayers wrong, why do it in such an obscure way? Why bother? The footage seems to exist to be described as ""beautiful."" Is it just art, or more lies? Since then, at least one woman has come forward to claim maternity of the child, though the Daily Mail reports she's also claimed to be the legal mother of North West, Prince George, and all three of Michael Jackson's kids. But whoever birthed Blue Ivy, one thing's for sure: that kid is definitely Jay's.

D2277746	http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20354669,00.html	12 Types of Birth Control	Home Birth Control12 Types of Birth Control Health.com March 26, 20101 of 13 Getty Images Weighing your options It’s easy to be confused by all the birth control options out there: Should you take a progestin-only pill or the mainstream combination pill? Can an IUD affect your chances of having children in the future? Is the female condom as effective as its male counterpart? Luckily, we have answers. Here are 12 of the most common birth control methods, and why you should or shouldn’t try them. Advertisement2 of 13 Getty Images Combination pill What it's called: Estrostep Fe, Lo Estrin 1/20, Ortho-Novum 7/7/7, Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo, Yasmin, Yaz What it does: This birth control mainstay is still 99% effective against pregnancy when taken around the same time every day. It's also known for easing hot flashes and restoring regular periods. Who should avoid it: Smokers and those 35 or older. The estrogen may cause dangerous blood clots. If you suffer from migraines, you should also pass because it may trigger the painful headaches.3 of 13 Getty Images Progestin-only pill What it's called: Micronor, Nora-BE, Nor-QD, Ovrette What it does: Known as the mini pill, progestin-only meds don't contain estrogen. They're safer for smokers, diabetics, and heart disease patients, as well as those at risk for blood clots. They also won't reduce the milk supply for women who are breast-feeding. Who should avoid it: If you have trouble remembering to take your pill at the same time every day, progestin-only pills might not be your best bet. They need to be taken at exactly the same time every day; if you're more than three hours late, plan on using a backup method. Advertisement4 of 13Extended-cycle pill What it's called: Lybrel, Seasonale, Seasonique What it does: These pills prevent pregnancy and allow you to have a period only every three months. (Note: Lybrel stops your period for a year, but you must take a pill every day, year-round.) Who should avoid it: There's no evidence proving it's dangerous not to have periods, but there is still no long-term research to show that it is safe. Advertisement5 of 13Vaginal ring What it's called: Nuva Ring What it does: The ring is made of flexible plastic and delivers estrogen and progestin, just like the combination pill. You place the ring in your vagina for three weeks, and then remove it for one week so that you have a regular period. Who should avoid it: Women who smoke, or have blood clots or certain cancers, should not use the Nuva Ring. Advertisement6 of 13 Getty Images Diaphragm What it's called: Milex Wide Seal, Ortho All-Flex, Semina, SILCS What it does: Made of rubber and shaped like a dome, a diaphragm prevents sperm from fertilizing an egg. It covers the cervix and must always be used with a spermicide. Women must be fitted for a diaphragm in their doctor's office. Who should avoid it: If your weight tends to fluctuate by more than 10 pounds at a time, the diaphragm may not work. If you gain or lose weight, you'll need to be refitted. Prone to bladder infections? You might want to consider another option. If you've had toxic shock syndrome, you shouldn't use a diaphragm. Advertisement7 of 13 Getty Images IUDWhat it's called: Mirena, Para Gard What it does: Para Gard is a surgically implanted copper device that prevents sperm from reaching the egg. Mirena, also surgically implanted, works by releasing hormones. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are more than 99% effective and good for 10 years. Who should avoid it: Some doctors recommend the device only for women who have given birth. When the device is implanted, your uterus is expanded, and this might cause pain in women who have not had children. If you're planning on having children in a year or two, look at other options. The IUD can be removed, but the high cost—up to $500—might not be worth it for short-term use. Advertisement8 of 13 Getty Images Female condom What it's called: Femy, Protectiv, Reality What it does: The female condom is made of polyurethane, or soft plastic, and protects against STDs. It is inserted deep into the vagina, over the cervix, much like a diaphragm. Unlike the male condom, the female condom can be put into place up to eight hours before sex. Who should avoid it: Male condoms offer more protection—both against STDs and pregnancy—than female condoms, so if you and your male partner aren't in a long-term, monogamous relationship, female condoms are not a perfect substitute. Advertisement9 of 13 Istockphoto Male condom What it's called: Durex, Life Styles, Trojan What it does: Male condoms protect against pregnancy and STDs, including HIV. Worn properly, condoms prevent sperm from entering the uterus. Go with latex or polyurethane condoms; lambskins do not shield you against all STDs. Who should avoid it: If your mate is allergic to latex or polyurethane, you'll have to find another option. And if you tend to use a lubricant that contains oil, such as hand lotion or baby oil, you'll need to switch to an oil-free option like K-Y Jelly, which, unlike oil-based lubricants, doesn't degrade latex. Advertisement10 of 13 Getty Images Patch What it's called: Ortho Evra What it does: You can place the hormone-releasing patch on your arm, buttock, or abdomen, and rest easy for one week. Who should avoid it: If you're particularly at risk for blood clots, you might want to find a different method. The patch delivers 60% more estrogen than a low-dose pill, so you're at an increased risk for dangerous blood clots. Advertisement11 of 13Implant What it's called: Implanon, Norplant What it does: About the size of a matchstick, the implant is placed under the skin on your upper arm. Implants last for three years and can cost up to $800. They are nearly 100% effective. Who should avoid it: Implanon may not work as well for women taking St. John's wort, or women who are overweight. Advertisement12 of 13Sterilization What it's called: Essure, tubal ligation, vasectomy What it does: Women can undergo either tubal ligation, a surgical procedure that blocks the fallopian tubes from carrying eggs to the uterus, or tubal implants (Essure), a nonsurgical technique in which a small coil is inserted into the fallopian tubes. The sterilization process is less risky for men: A vasectomy is a minor surgery in which the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles are cut. Who should avoid it: If you plan to have children, sterilization is not an option—it's not designed to be reversible. Advertisement13 of 13 Getty Images Emergency contraception What it's called: Copper T IUD, Next Choice, Plan B, Plan B One-Step What it does: Emergency contraception is a backup for regular birth control. Plan B contains a higher dose of the same synthetic hormones found in the combination pill. It works best if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, but may work up to five days later. There's also the copper T IUD, which a doctor can insert into your uterus five to seven days after unprotected sex. Who should avoid it: Plan B, known as the morning-after pill, is available over-the-counter at most pharmacies, but only to women 18 years and older. Minors need a prescription. Copper T IUDs can be very expensive—up to $500. Plus, they last for up to 10 years, so if you hope to get pregnant in the future, this isn't for you. You May Like Read More

It is believed to have originated in the Americas, but is now found around the world Rhododendron Some species of rhododendron are poisonous to grazing animals because of a toxin called grayanotoxin in their pollen and nectar. People have been known to become ill from eating honey made by bees feeding on rhododendron and azalea flowers. Ageratina altissima Ageratina altissima, also known as white snakeroot is a poisonous perennial herb in the family Asteraceae, native to eastern North America. White Snakeroot contains the toxin tremetol; when the plants are consumed by cattle, the meat and milk become contaminated with the toxin. When milk or meat containing the toxin is consumed, the poison is passed on to humans. If consumed in large enough quantities, it can cause tremetol poisoning in humans. The poisoning is also called milk sickness, as humans often ingested the toxin by drinking the milk of cows that had eaten snakeroot. Hydrangea Hydrangeas are moderately toxic if eaten, with all parts of the plant containing cyanogenic glycosides. Hydrangea paniculata is reportedly sometimes smoked as an intoxicant, despite the danger of illness and/or death due to the cyanide. Taxus baccata Most parts of the tree are toxic, except the bright red aril surrounding the seed. The foliage remains toxic even when wilted, and toxicity increases in potency when dried. Ingestion and subsequent excretion by birds whose beaks and digestive systems do not break down the seed's coating are the primary means of yew dispersal. Water hemlock Cicuta, commonly known as water hemlock, is a small genus of four species of highly poisonous plants in the family Apiaceae. Water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants, being highly poisonous to humans. Three members of the genus contain a toxin named cicutoxin which causes central nervous system stimulatory effects including seizures following ingestion. Castor oil plant The castor oil plant (Ricinus communis) is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It belongs to a monotypic genus, Ricinus, and subtribe, Ricininae. The evolution of castor and its relation to other species are currently being studied using modern genetic tools An alcoholic extract of the leaf was shown, in lab rats, to protect the liver from damage from certain poisons Rosary Pea Abrus precatorius, known commonly as jequirity, Crab's eye, rosary pea, precatory pea or bean,The toxin abrin is a dimer consisting of two protein subunits, termed A and B. The B chain facilitates abrin's entry into a cell by bonding to certain transport proteins on cell membranes, which then transport the toxin into the cell. Once inside the cell, the A chain prevents protein synthesis by inactivating the 26S subunit of the ribosome. One molecule of abrin will inactivate up to 1,500 ribosomes per second. Atropa belladonna Atropa bella-donna, commonly known as Belladonna or Deadly Nightshade, Belladonna is one of the most toxic plants found in the Eastern Hemisphere. All parts of the plant contain tropane alkaloids. The berries pose the greatest danger to children because they look attractive and have a somewhat sweet taste. The consumption of two to five berries by a human adult is probably lethal. The root of the plant is generally the most toxic part, though this can vary from one specimen to another. Ingestion of a single leaf of the plant can be fatal to an adult Nerium Oleander Nerium oleander is an evergreen shrub or small tree in the dogbane family Apocynaceae, toxic in all its parts. Oleander poisoning occurs when someone sucks nectar from the flowers or chews leaves from the oleander or yellow oleander plant. Poisoning can also happen if you eat honey made by bees that used the oleander plant for nectar. Show more Loading...

Also, you may get better responses in the Business Math forum. Here is a definition of the US Rule: The US Rule determines interest paid on the loan after a partial payment is made before the due date of the loan. The partial payment pays the interest first for that given time and then a part of the principal. The interest for the remaining part of the loan is calculated on the new principal and the days since the partial payment. When applying the US Rule, the Banker's Rule is used to calculate the interest (360 days = 1 year and any fractional part of a year = exact number of days. )Follow Math Help Forum on Facebook and Google+Sep 30th 2010, 10:35 AM #4emakarov MHF Contributor Joined Oct 2009Posts 5,577Thanks 790Disclaimer: my specialization is mathematical logic. (All calculations done in Open Office Calc.) Between the effective date and the partial payment date there are 238 date. Therefore, the interest on that date was 257.83. The partial payment is greater that that interest, so the balance of the payment is applied to the principle. Therefore, the new principle is 2757.83. Between the partial payment date and the maturity date there are 44 days, so the interest is 21.91. So, the balance due is 21.91. Follow Math Help Forum on Facebook and Google+ 
D2663454	http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Nuclear/tracer.html	Radioactivity is Unaffected by Physical or Chemical State	"Radioactivity is Unaffected by Physical or Chemical State The radioactive half-life for a given radioisotope is a measure of the tendency of the nucleus to ""decay"" or ""disintegrate"" and as such is based purely upon that probability. The tiny nuclear size compared to the atom and the enormity of the forces which act within it make it almost totally impervious to the outside world. The half-life is independent of the physical state (solid, liquid, gas), temperature, pressure, the chemical compound in which the nucleus finds itself, and essentially any other outside influence. It is independent of the chemistry of the atomic surface, and independent of the ordinary physical factors of the outside world. The only thing which can alter the half-life is direct nuclear interaction with a particle from outside, e.g., a high energy collision in an accelerator. Even in that case, the nature of the nucleus is changed, as in the bombardment of nitrogen nuclei in the atmosphere which is the basis for carbon dating. As long as the nucleus of the isotope remains intact, the half-life of a radioactive tracer can be depended upon. Index "
